       "['Operatorships on the move Operator responsibility for Snorre, Visund, Tordis and Vigdis in the Tampen area of the North Sea passed from Norsk Hydro to Statoil at midnight on 31 December. The two companies have been preparing for the change-over since the summer of 2000, reports Svein G Larsen, who has headed the transfer project in Exploration & Production Norway. “Work has gone very smoothly, with companies and union officials cooperating extremely well,” he says. “Everyone has put in a lot of effort to complete the process.” The transfer means that Statoil will become the only operator in Tampen area which also includes Statfjord and Gullfaks as well as a number of subsea developments tied back to the main fields. A million barrels of oil equivalent are delivered every day from this area, corresponding to 28 per cent of total Norwegian offshore output. The hand-over also brings Statoil 550 new and motivated employees, including about 250 employed offshore on Snorre A and B as well as the Visund platform. Just under 50 Visund personnel will be moving into the group’s Sandsli offices just outside Bergen. At the same time, 200 new colleagues – mostly attached to the Snorre organisation – are due to join existing Statoil staff at the Forus West offices in Stavanger. About another 50 people will be incorporated in other entities, such as corporate services and central staff functions, at Forus West, Forus East and Forushagen. The operatorship changes were agreed in connection with Hydro’s acquisition of Saga Petroleum in 1999. Operator responsibility for Snorre, Visund, Tordis and Vigdis in the Tampen area of the North Sea passed from Norsk Hydro to Statoil at midnight on 31 December. The two companies have been preparing for the change-over since the summer of 2000, reports Svein G Larsen, who has headed the transfer project in Exploration & Production Norway. “Work has gone very smoothly, with companies and union officials cooperating extremely well,” he says. “Everyone has put in a lot of effort to complete the process.” The transfer means that Statoil will become the only operator in Tampen area which also includes Statfjord and Gullfaks as well as a number of subsea developments tied back to the main fields. A million barrels of oil equivalent are delivered every day from this area, corresponding to 28 per cent of total Norwegian offshore output. The hand-over also brings Statoil 550 new and motivated employees, including about 250 employed offshore on Snorre A and B as well as the Visund platform. Just under 50 Visund personnel will be moving into the group’s Sandsli offices just outside Bergen.

       " 'Clean-up skills for Spain A Norwegian resource group with Statoil participation is providing oil spill collection technology for the effort to clean up in the wake of the Prestige tanker disaster off north-west Spain. In connection with its Norne development in the Norwegian Sea during the 1990s, Statoil headed development work on innovative specialised equipment to collect spilt oil. This system is also very suitable for collecting the highly viscous oil now leaking from the sunken vessel’s tanks. Three skimmers have been loaned to the Spanish clean-up campaign, but sufficient equipment remains in Norway to maintain emergency cover for Norne. “We think it’s positive that technology and expertise available in Norway to combat oil spills can also be used elsewhere in a good and effective way,” says Stig Bergseth, Statoil’s senior vice president for health, safety and the environment. The resource group has been established by the Norwegian Clean Seas Association for Operating Companies ( Nofo ), and operations director Jon Rødal has visited the wreck site. “We’re very pleased with the efficiency displayed by this equipment in collecting the thick oil,” he says. “This is Norwegian technology at its best.” He adds that about 1,000 tonnes of oil have been collected over the past couple of days. The Nofo spread involved in the clean-up effort comprises the Far Scout supply ship, carrying two of the skimmers, and the Boa Siv tug. These vessels deploy an ocean-going boom between them. A second spread is on its way to Spain and will arrive before the weekend, Mr Rødal reports. The 26-year-old Bahamas-registered Prestige ran into difficulties off the Spanish coast on 13 November. After six days, the 40,000-tonner broke in two and sank in 3,500 metres of water.

       " \"New transport company created Eight gas transport systems belonging to Statoil and nine other companies are being merged today, 20 December, into a common ownership structure under the name GasLed. The agreement on this unitisation was signed during a press conference at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Oslo this afternoon. Statoil has a 20.4 per cent interest in the new company, where its partners are Petoro, Norsk Hydro , TotalFinaElf , ExxonMobil , Shell , ConocoPhillips , Agip , Fortum and Norsea Gas. In addition to creating GasLed, the partners have also concluded a collaboration agreement for the restructured system. “The new ownership structure is important for the companies since it both simplifies and improves the transport system,” explains Statoil project manager Erik Kjos-Hanssen in Natural Gas. “That’s because we achieve a number of commercial simplifications and administrative savings. “Securing unified ownership for the transport systems also reduces the chance that conflicts of interest might arise between the various partners.” New regulations were adopted by the government today to govern access to Norway’s offshore gas transport systems and determine tariffs for leasing capacity from GasLed. The new company embraces the transport systems previously known as Åsgard Transport, Statpipe, Europipe II, Zeepipe, Franpipe, Oseberg Gas Transport, Vesterled and Norpipe. It also includes the gas treatment complex at Kårstø north of Stavanger as well as three receiving terminals at Emden in northern Germany and one at St Fergus in the UK. Ownership of the receiving terminals at Zeebrugge in Belgium and Dunkerque in France will also be adjusted following the creation of GasLed. The company will be operational from 1 January.

       " \"Kvitebjørn topside ready The topside for Statoil’s Kvitebjørn development has been installed on a barge at the ABB Offshore Systems yard in Haugesund north of Stavanger for tow-out to the North Sea field on 1 March. Specialists from Dutch transporter Mammoet ensured that the 10,500 tonnes of structural steel and equipment were loaded out from the fabrication shop, over the quay and onto the barge. Forty-eight large self-powered transporters with a total of 1,664 wheels were used for the job, reports Inge Klokkeide, Statoil's manager for testing and commissioning. The topside is about 100 metres long, 45 metres wide and 40 metres tall. Remaining fabrication, testing and commissioning will be done on the barge until the tow-out. Project director Bjarne Bakken at Statoil reports that plans call for the jacket and topside to be lifted into position on the gas and condensate (light oil) field during March. Aker Verdal in mid-Norway completed fabrication of the jacket earlier this year, and the structure is spending the winter at parent company Aker Kværner’s yard in Stavanger. Hectic activity is under way at fabricator Heerema Tønsberg south of Oslo to finish the Kvitebjørn derrick, drill floor and mud module. “Completion work on the drilling package is rather behind the topside, but these units will also be ready for installation in March,” Mr Bakken says. “The period until drilling begins in August will be used for hook-up, testing and readying for operation.” Leirvik Module Technology built the living quarters for the Kvitebjørn platform, and this unit was installed on the topside during the summer. Work on Kvitebjørn ’s gas and condensate pipelines is on schedule. They will run to Statoil’s Kollsnes and Mongstad plants respectively in the Bergen area, with laying due to start next spring.

       " 'Ormen Lange gas to go via Sleipner Ormen Lange in the Norwegian Sea is to be developed with subsea production installations linked to land, and gas export via Statoil’s Sleipner East field in the North Sea. The field licensees agreed this on 18 December. A formal decision will be taken with the plan for development and operation (PDO), due to be submitted to the Norwegian authorities in 2003. “Deciding to export via Sleipner East will strengthen this field as a gas hub,” says Alv Bjørn Solheim, vice president for business development in the Troll/Sleipner business cluster. “That gives us the flexibility to reach customers in continental Europe or the UK, and will have positive spin-offs for the field over many years to come.” The gas will be exported with the existing Sleipner R riser platform, which is tied to continental Europe by pipeline. Opportunities for sales to the growing UK market are also seen by the Ormen Lange partners, and a decision on this option is likely to be taken in the first quarter of 2003. Storage in the Sleipner area to cope with seasonal variations in demand could also be possible. That could give the field an important role as a swing producer. Ormen Lange lies in 800-1,000 metres of water, 100 kilometres off the Norwegian coast. Its gas will be landed to a new treatment and export facility in Aukra local authority near the port of Molde, down the coast from Statoil’s existing Tjeldbergodden complex. The field is thought to contain some 375 billion cubic metres of gas and 138 million barrels (22 million cubic metres) of condensate (light oil). This makes Ormen Lange the largest gas development being planned for the Norwegian continental shelf. Due to come on stream in October 2007, the field is expected to produce for 30-40 years. The total bill for offshore development and a gas trunkline from the treatment plant to Sleipner East is put at roughly NOK 55 billion. Norsk Hydro is the development operator, with Shell scheduled to take over in the production phase. The other licensees are Petoro, Statoil, ExxonMobil and BP.

       " '\\'A pioneer project on the Norwegian Continental Shelf\\' Ormen Lange is a pioneer project on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The field is located on the Atlantic Margin in the Norwegian Sea where climatic and oceanographic conditions present some of the most challenging development environments in the world. Among the challenges we find: Location of the field in a deep subsea scar area left by the Storegga slide 8,000 years ago where the seabed, at a water depth of between 800 and 1,000 meters, is heavily undulated with slide debris protruding 30 to 60 meters up from the sea bottom. A major task has been to identify a secure route for control cables and pipelines out of the deepwater production area to shore. The interaction between the Gulf Stream and cold polar currents from the north creates special conditions that generate significant forces on risers, mooring, gas pipelines and subsea installations, and presents special requirements for field installations. Combined wind and wave forces in the Ormen Lange area are more challenging than in any other deepwater project in the world. Water movements in the area caused by polar currents contribute to driving the Gulf Stream. The same water movements bring cold water down from the north and generate water temperatures below freezing for most of the year on the seabed around pipelines and subsea installations in the deep water production area.

The same water movements bring cold water down from the north and generate water temperatures below freezing for most of the year on the seabed around pipelines and subsea installations in the deep water production area. All of the above present special demands on the License, the Operator and associated contributing companies. Norwegian engineering and research environments have dominated development of technical design and solutions for the recommended concept for Ormen Lange. Key areas of Norwegian industry and research institutions have been engaged to study and provide solutions to a number of new and unique challenges compared with other oil and gas developments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and as a consequence have achieved leading global competence within their particular business areas. Routing of the gas pipelines in and out of the Storegga scar area has been decided in close cooperation with fishery organizations and authorities. Through extensive survey and mapping operations, in cooperation with recognized Norwegian and international expertise, the stability of seabed masses and slide safety have been carefully investigated. There are no indications that new slides can be initiated, either naturally or from Ormen Lange development activities. Growing gas market The European gas market is growing. Both the UK and large parts of continental Europe have forecast a need for more gas. Ormen Lange will be an important supplier with a daily capacity of between 50 and 70 Sm3, giving an annual production of approximately 20 billion Sm3. This corresponds to supply covering more than 15 percent of UK gas requirements, or Norway\\'s total energy consumption, be that electricity, heating and fuel. Ormen Lange will require construction of a new gas transportation infrastructure. The associated pipeline project will be one of the largest ever undertaken worldwide. Gas is planned to be transported in a pipeline approximately 1,200 km long from Nyhamna in Aukra municipality all the way to UK, via the tie-in point at Sleipner. Sleipner will only function as a distribution point on the Norwegian side of the demarcation line, to provide the possibility of export to either the UK or to continental Europe as required. If a decision is made to build a new pipeline, the landing point in the UK will be identified during 1Q 2003, according to plan. Before an eventual decision is taken on a potential new pipeline between the existing tie-in platform and UK, use of existing pipelines on the British side shall be thoroughly evaluated. Choice between two main development concepts Both of the main development concepts have been studied and considered from an economic, technical, health, environmental and safety perspective. During development of the full processing offshore concept, three different platform alternatives were considered: Tension leg platform (\"TLP\"), Semi-submersible platform (\"Semi\"), Single spar platform (\"Spar\"). Given the enormous gas export capacity planned from Ormen Lange, platforms required would have been among the largest in the world, should these have been constructed. Location and connection of a total 20-24 wells, that must be progressively drilled to drain Ormen Lange, have been studied and developed based on knowledge of reservoir characteristics known since the first well was drilled in 1997 and up to the last appraisal well drilled in May 2002. A particular challenge has been to secure security of gas supply, considering potential hydrates (ice plugs) forming in pipelines in seabed areas where the water temperature is at or below freezing point. In Spring 2000, Ormen Lange project entered into a cooperation agreement with the county of Møre and Romsdal, through their established \"Ormen to Møre\" project group. The cooperation had the objective of determining an optimal landing point for Ormen Lange. Fourteen possible landing locations were initially given to the project by the municipality, together with relevant and extensive supporting data. This saved time and allowed the Ormen Lange project to start immediate selection activities. At the end of 2000, 14 possible landing locations were deduced to seven. In June 2001, a further reduction from seven to four sites was completed. They were Tjeldbergodden in Aure municipality, Stavnes in Averøy municipality, Nyhamna in Aukra municipality, and Baraldses in Haram municipality. These four locations were further developed to a sufficient degree of maturity such that the Ormen Lange could announce on March 14, 2002, that Nyhamna in Aukra municipality was considered the best alternative. State-of-the-art onshore processing plant Nyhamna is an attractive location for Ormen Lange and offers the optimal solution, for example, in safety and flexibility regarding future possibilities of establishing a gas node. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the onshore processing plant has already been issued for review to interested parties, while the EIA for the total project is ready for release in the coming days. The processing plant at Aukra will encompass a total of some 4.3 km2, inclusive of noise and safety zones. Products produced will be sales gas and stabilized condensate (a very light oil). The plant will be operated with power from the grid. Statnett is in the process of preparing new 420 kV facilities, and in addition, a 132 kV emergency power supply. Gas pipelines in and out of Nyhamna are currently planned to be routed through Bjørnsundet. Routing over Aukra and out of Horremsbukta is maintained as an alternative should Bjørnsundet become too narrow. During construction of the onshore plant, it is estimated peak manning of some 2,000 persons will be reached in 2006. Completed process and export facilities will require some 100 persons for the operations phase as of 2007. The onshore processing plant will be a state-of-the-art facility with regards to health, safety and environment. The plant will be characterized by space provided for effective safety solutions, good approach for marine vessels, high overall safety, efficient use of energy, effective cleansing of production water, re-cycling of volatile organic compounds (VOC), a closed flare system and low emissions. The onshore plant at Aukra in Møre and Romsdal is designed such that it will be possible to extend the capacity of the plant. Back to main article: Ormen Lange is a pioneer project on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The field is located on the Atlantic Margin in the Norwegian Sea where climatic and oceanographic conditions present some of the most challenging development environments in the world. Among the challenges we find: Location of the field in a deep subsea scar area left by the Storegga slide 8,000 years ago where the seabed, at a water depth of between 800 and 1,000 meters, is heavily undulated with slide debris protruding 30 to 60 meters up from the sea bottom. A major task has been to identify a secure route for control cables and pipelines out of the deepwater production area to shore. The interaction between the Gulf Stream and cold polar currents from the north creates special conditions that generate significant forces on risers, mooring, gas pipelines and subsea installations, and presents special requirements for field installations. Combined wind and wave forces in the Ormen Lange area are more challenging than in any other deepwater project in the world. Water movements in the area caused by polar currents contribute to driving the Gulf Stream. The same water movements bring cold water down from the north and generate water temperatures below freezing for most of the year on the seabed around pipelines and subsea installations in the deep water production area.

The same water movements bring cold water down from the north and generate water temperatures below freezing for most of the year on the seabed around pipelines and subsea installations in the deep water production area. All of the above present special demands on the License, the Operator and associated contributing companies. Norwegian engineering and research environments have dominated development of technical design and solutions for the recommended concept for Ormen Lange. Key areas of Norwegian industry and research institutions have been engaged to study and provide solutions to a number of new and unique challenges compared with other oil and gas developments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and as a consequence have achieved leading global competence within their particular business areas. Routing of the gas pipelines in and out of the Storegga scar area has been decided in close cooperation with fishery organizations and authorities. Through extensive survey and mapping operations, in cooperation with recognized Norwegian and international expertise, the stability of seabed masses and slide safety have been carefully investigated. There are no indications that new slides can be initiated, either naturally or from Ormen Lange development activities. Growing gas market The European gas market is growing. Both the UK and large parts of continental Europe have forecast a need for more gas. Ormen Lange will be an important supplier with a daily capacity of between 50 and 70 Sm3, giving an annual production of approximately 20 billion Sm3. This corresponds to supply covering more than 15 percent of UK gas requirements, or Norway\\'s total energy consumption, be that electricity, heating and fuel. Ormen Lange will require construction of a new gas transportation infrastructure. The associated pipeline project will be one of the largest ever undertaken worldwide. Gas is planned to be transported in a pipeline approximately 1,200 km long from Nyhamna in Aukra municipality all the way to UK, via the tie-in point at Sleipner. Sleipner will only function as a distribution point on the Norwegian side of the demarcation line, to provide the possibility of export to either the UK or to continental Europe as required. If a decision is made to build a new pipeline, the landing point in the UK will be identified during 1Q 2003, according to plan. Before an eventual decision is taken on a potential new pipeline between the existing tie-in platform and UK, use of existing pipelines on the British side shall be thoroughly evaluated. Choice between two main development concepts Both of the main development concepts have been studied and considered from an economic, technical, health, environmental and safety perspective.

       " 'Precautionary landing on Draugen None of the 18 people on board were injured when a helicopter made a safety landing on the Draugen platform in the Norwegian Sea earlier today, 17 December. The helicopter was en route from Kristiansund in mid-Norway to the Statoil-operated Heidrun platform in the Norwegian Sea. The pilots took the decision to land on the Draugen platform, operated by Shell, when a warning light flashed, indicating too high a temperature in the tail gear box. The temperature warning appears to have been due to an indicator error. The Super Puma L2 helicopter belongs to CHC Helikopter Service. The pilots have checked the helicopter and given it the all-clear to fly back to land without passengers. Alternative ways of transporting the passengers over to Heidrun are being considered.

       " 'Dry in Blåmeis No hydrocarbons were encountered with an exploration well drilled by Statoil on the Blåmeis prospect in the Norne area of the Norwegian Sea. “This well was drilled in a prospect with a large oil potential, but which was also regarded as high risk,” says Roger Inge Johansen, exploration manager for the area. “So the result wasn’t very surprising. But we’re disappointed all the same.” The 6608/11-3 wildcat was drilled in production licence 128, about 15 kilometres east of Statoil’s Norne field, with the aim of proving oil in Jurassic sandstones. Drilling terminated at a depth of roughly 2,000 metres, in Triassic sediments. PL 128 embraces blocks 6608/10 and 11, where earlier discoveries include Stær, Svale and Falk as well as Norne . The well was drilled by Stena Don in 21 days – about a week faster than planned. “This rig has once again done a very efficient job, and the operation was implemented without accidents to people or material assets,” says Mr Johansen. The results of this well will have no impact on the future exploration programme in the Norne area. Two new wildcats have been approved by the licensees. They will be on the Lerke and Gråspett prospects, and are due to be spudded in the first half of 2003.

       " 'Snøhvit cost framework increased The cost framework for Statoil’s Snøhvit project in the Barents Sea has been increased by NOK 5.8 billion, from NOK 39.5 billion to a total of NOK 45.3 billion. This project continues to provide satisfactory profitability for the group at a gas price which corresponds to an oil price of USD 14.50 (in 2000 money) per barrel over the field’s whole producing life. “We have conducted a detailed review of the development project,” says Statoil chief executive Olav Fjell. “That work has reduced uncertainty over costs and project execution, giving us now a good basis for implementing the development in accordance with updated plans.” Snøhvit is the first development in Europe based on liquefied natural gas (LNG). It involves the use of innovative technology, and its facilities will be large and complex. Following the project review, Statoil has already strengthened supervision of work on the gas treatment and liquefaction plant at Melkøya outside Hammerfest in northern Norway. This reinforcement focuses both on its own organisation and in relation to the main contractor, Linde. “The main reason for the cost increase is that the plant’s capacity was increased by 30 per cent at an early stage,” says Egil Gjesteland, project director for Snøhvit. “At the same time, the consequences of such an expansion in a large gas liquefaction facility were underestimated.” The change has resulted in a substantial rise in the weight of the land plant. In addition, costs rose because the start of construction work was delayed by discussions with the Efta Surveillance Authority (ESA) over the tax regime for the project. Statoil has a 22.29 per cent interest in Snøhvit . The NOK 5.8 billion cost increase accordingly corresponds to a nominal value per share, after tax, of NOK 0.04 for the group.

       " 'HSE prize for service vessels The 2002 chief executive’s prize for health, safety and the environment has been awarded to Statoil’s maritime operations sector and the companies operating service vessels for the group. Following a negative trend in 1997-2000, the sector initiated extensive work to clarify the causes of poor HSE results on these ships and to identify ways of reversing the trend. These efforts have led to a very positive development in terms of both injuries and collisions between vessels and installations. While 12 of the latter incidents were registered in 2000, this figure for the same ships on Statoil assignments has fallen to two over the past two years. Service vessels perform supply, standby and anchorhandling duties for Norwegian offshore operations. Statoil has about 30 of these ships on charter at any given time, and this number can rise to 70 during periods of high activity. Measures adopted include strengthening vessel crews with an additional navigator, and a conscious effort to improve communication between the players involved in these operations. According to the award jury, this is a good example of the way in which high HSE standards can also yield efficient operation. The general level of Norwegian offshore safety has been improved, in that the work has established good attitudes as well as developing standards which have become industry norms.

       " 'Solsikke well dry Hydro has finished drilling its Solsikke well in the Norwegian Sea without finding hydrocarbons. Solsikke lies on license 253 in the Norwegian Sea some 200 kilometers off the north-west coast of Norway at a sea depth of about 1,800 meters. Exploration well 6403/10-1 was drilled by the rig \"Scarabeo 5\" to test out a geological model in the western part of the Møre Basin.

       " 'Tore Torvund: \"Oil production is increasing.\" This year Hydro\\'s oil and gas production will increase by 12 percent. Next year an increase of eight percent - up to 510,000 barrels a day is forecast. From then on oil production will increase by eight percent a year at least until the end of 2006. The most important ambition aside of finding and recovering more oil and gas is cost discipline. The increases in production delineated at Hydro\\'s capital markets day in Oslo on Monday were not empty bubbles of gas. They are supported by the plans for new fields that will come onstream during the next four years. One of these is the Hydro-operated field Grane, which is expected to contribute 77,000 barrels a day when it comes into production in October next year. Indications so far suggest that the price will be one billion krone below budget. Focus on international oil production While the Hydro-operated development of Ormen Lange will supply Europe with large volumes of gas towards the end of this decade, it is oil that Hydro is primarily looking for in the international arena. Exploration in block 34 in Angola, for which expectations were high, was the year\\'s major disappointment. However, as Torvund underlines, there have been several findings in 2002, which are under closer evaluation. \"In the international arena we believe that Hebron and Annapolis in Canada, further development in Angola, Anaran in Iran and Murzuk in Libya are interesting projects,\" said Tore Torvund. In this connection he underlined the value of the collaboration with partners Petro-Canada, Sonangol in Angola, NIOC in Iran and TotalFinaElf in Libya. He pointed out that the results of the current international exploration program will be thoroughly assessed before the company considers taking further steps.

New remelt plants in Spain and Texas, and the new metal plant in Sunndal are in operation, while VAW Flexible Packaging has been sold. Market positions have been given a boost in a weak market, said executive vice president Jon-Harald Nilsen at Monday\\'s Capital Markets Day in Oslo. At the same time he underlined Hydro Aluminium\\'s main focus will still be cost improvements. The company\\'s strengths are innovative business solutions, good customer relations and the ability to operate plants at high productivity levels. He stated that Hydro Aluminium in 2004 would meet the company\\'s required CROGI - Cash Return On Gross Investment - target of 10 percent. \"We are expecting a certain increase in aluminium shipments in 2003,\" said Nilsen, who could point to more shipments from rolling mills and extrusion plants of late, but who also said that there is still much uncertainty regarding the world economy. \"Still, we have managed to boost our position considerably in a difficult market situation.\" As far as primary metal is concerned, the aluminium industry\\'s attention is turned towards developments in China. The country has traditionally been an importer of aluminium, but is expected to become a net exporter in the years to come. Meanwhile the situation in the USA North West, where large sections of the aluminium industry are still closed because of power shortages, is being closely monitored. Five nationality-strong management team Internally it is the integration of the German aluminium company VAW and the French building system company Technal that has been the main focus during the past year. Both these comprehensive processes have been completed quickly and without major problems. Nilsen characterizes the efficiency of the integration as setting a new industry standard. Following the merger, there are now five nationalities in Hydro Aluminium\\'s top management team. Cost improvements in metal plants The production costs of primary metal are coming down and will be further reduced as a large section of the new Sunndal plant comes on stream. More and more production will take place at large, effective and environmentally adapted plants, while the smallest metal plants will largely benefit from their proximity to markets and their production of high value cast products. As 2002 draws to a close, the company\\'s casthouses will have handled three million tonnes of aluminium in the course of the year. Costs per tonne have been reduced, and Hydro has been a driving force in restructuring this market. Strength downstream Over several decades, Hydro has built up a very effective management model for its extensive extrusion business in Europe. Productivity at the company\\'s plants in Europe is considerably better than in the USA. Expertise from the European system will therefore be put in place to improve operations at the American plants. \"As regards rolled products, the company increased its turnover several times following the acquisition of VAW. Hydro is now one of the four major players in this market with an especially strong position in the litho, foil and automotive sheet markets,\" added Nilsen. Better balance Senior vice president Arvid Moss pointed to the fact that there is a better balance in Hydro Aluminium, after the VAW acquisition, between primary production and downstream as the share of rolled products has grown. Its primary metal position has also been given a boost, through low-cost plants outside Europe, while automotive activities have been expanded to embrace cast products and sheet. \"We have achieved a critical size in new areas,\" he said. One of the challenges ahead will be to reduce primary metal production costs and further develop downstream activities in Europe and in selected markets outside Europe.

       " 'John Ottestad: \"Operational performance our first priority\" \"Continuous result improvement from operations is our first priority. I am glad to report that our business areas are delivering in this respect,\" said executive vice president and CFO John O. Ottestad at Hydro\\'s Capital Markets Day in Oslo on Monday. \"With regard to capital expenditures we are exerting strict capital discipline, sharpening our return requirements and scrutinising project robustness. Completion of major capital expenditure projects on time and within budget is critical in a capital intensive industry like Norsk Hydro’s and we are delivering in this respect,\" said Ottestad. Ottestad pointed out that Hydro is well on track to meet its divestment target of NOK 10 billion by the end of 2003. Agreements for divestment of businesses valued at NOK 6 billion had so far been entered into. Since 1999 the company has divested businesses for NOK 22 billion. John O. Ottestad\\'s presentation (PDF 340 KB) This year, Hydro has purchased businesses for NOK 28 billion, the acquisition of VAW constituting the major portion. I am satisfied that not only the SDFI acquisition, which is benefiting from high oil prices, but also VAW and Technal, which experience challenging aluminium markets, are all accretive to earnings in 2002. John Ottestad termed Hydro’s financial position as strong. Liquidity reserves are comfortable, the long-term funding solid and our debt/equity ratio meets our long term target of 0.5. \"We intend to keep our single-A rating\", he underscored. \"We repeatedly demonstrate our ability to deliver on promises to bring our debt/equity ratio swiftly back to our long-term target after completing major acquisitions like Saga and VAW.\" Hydro’s key financial measure is CROGI - Cash Return On Gross Investment. Given Gross Investments of NOK 270 billion in the denominator of this ratio, and a requirement for a 10 percent CROGI, cash earnings after tax will have to be NOK 27 billion for the target to be met. Ottestad described CROGI as an important indicator serving management well in monitoring progress on improvement measures. This year CROGI at average cycle \"normalised\" prices is expected to end up in the bracket eight to nine percent. Next year’s ambition is half a percentage point higher, not counting on any help from the markets. Aluminium, which is lagging the two other business areas on CROGI performance, is making major steps forward in 2002, a development expected to continue in 2003,\" concluded Ottestad. John O. Ottestad\\'s presentation (PDF 340 KB) \"Continuous result improvement from operations is our first priority. I am glad to report that our business areas are delivering in this respect,\" said executive vice president and CFO John O. Ottestad at Hydro\\'s Capital Markets Day in Oslo on Monday. \"With regard to capital expenditures we are exerting strict capital discipline, sharpening our return requirements and scrutinising project robustness. Completion of major capital expenditure projects on time and within budget is critical in a capital intensive industry like Norsk Hydro’s and we are delivering in this respect,\" said Ottestad. Ottestad pointed out that Hydro is well on track to meet its divestment target of NOK 10 billion by the end of 2003. Agreements for divestment of businesses valued at NOK 6 billion had so far been entered into. Since 1999 the company has divested businesses for NOK 22 billion. John O. Ottestad\\'s presentation (PDF 340 KB) This year, Hydro has purchased businesses for NOK 28 billion, the acquisition of VAW constituting the major portion. I am satisfied that not only the SDFI acquisition, which is benefiting from high oil prices, but also VAW and Technal, which experience challenging aluminium markets, are all accretive to earnings in 2002. John Ottestad termed Hydro’s financial position as strong. Liquidity reserves are comfortable, the long-term funding solid and our debt/equity ratio meets our long term target of 0.5. \"We intend to keep our single-A rating\", he underscored. \"We repeatedly demonstrate our ability to deliver on promises to bring our debt/equity ratio swiftly back to our long-term target after completing major acquisitions like Saga and VAW.\" Hydro’s key financial measure is CROGI - Cash Return On Gross Investment. Given Gross Investments of NOK 270 billion in the denominator of this ratio, and a requirement for a 10 percent CROGI, cash earnings after tax will have to be NOK 27 billion for the target to be met.

       " 'Eivind Reiten: Hydro is delivering Provided that market conditions do not take a turn for the worse, Hydro expects to deliver better results in 2003 than in 2002. President and CEO Eivind Reiten is raising next years CROGI profitability target up from the current years 8-9 to 8.5-9.5 percent. The target for Hydros oil and gas production is increased to 510,000 barrels in 2003. Eivind Reiten\\'s main message to the financial community at the company\\'s annual Capital Markets Day on Monday was that Hydro is delivering! \"We are delivering results, developing our portfolio and implementing improvements as promised,\" emphasized Reiten. He pointed out that a lot has happened since he last convened analysts from far and wide to a such a large gathering in Oslo. Market conditions have been adverse since he took over as Hydro\\'s President and CEO 19 ago: Oil prices have been high yet unstable, aluminium prices low and fertilizer prices below the long-term trend. Hydro\\'s head man stressed the importance of active portfolio management in growing the group\\'s businesses. \"VAW was not only an important acquisition in terms of boosting our aluminium business, but also with regard to our capacity to take over and integrate such a big company,\" he added. It was not only the integration that was effected quickly and relatively smoothly. Hydro\\'s financial strength was soon regained and is firmly back on target for a debt/equity ratio of 0.5, largely due to high cash-flows from the company\\'s businesses. Projects, acquisitions and divestments proceed as planned Reiten added that VAW was not the only acquisition Hydro made last year, as there was also the French aluminium company Technal and some of the state-owned licenses in North Sea oil fields. On the other hand, a substantial share of the Danish agricultural company KFK has been divested. An agreement has been signed relating to the sale of the aluminium business VAW Flexible Packaging, and certain oil and gas licenses have been sold. In total, Hydro has divested businesses totaling NOK 22 billion since 1999. \"All our major development projects are well underway, while several of them are ahead of schedule in terms of delivery time and cost,\" stated Reiten, singling out the Grane field in the North Sea, the Qafco expansion in Qatar, the first phase of the new aluminium metal plant in Sunndal, which was opened just a few days ago, plus Alunorte in Brazil. Eivind Reiten underscored that Hydro also delivers improved safety. \"In the course of the past year we have succeeded in further improving our safety record, which was good at the outset. VAW joined Hydro earlier this year with a considerably higher accident rate. In the course of recent months the number of injuries has been firmly reduced, bringing them gradually into line with the norm for the rest of Hydro. Oil and Energy is delivering The Oil and Energy business area is delivering some very good results, due not only to high oil prices. \"I can confirm that we are well on the way to achieving our extended target of oil production totaling 470,000 barrels per day in 2003. This represents an increase of 12 percent compared to the previous year. In 2003 we are counting on producing 510,000 barrels per day, and have prolonged by one more year, to 2006, our target for annual growth of eight percent. Our reserve replacement ratio will be above 1 in both 2003 and 2004. Reiten referred also to the extensive international drilling program the company is currently carrying out. This program, which has so far been disappointing, will be completed in 2003, and new programs will only be implemented following a rigorous examination of international activities in 2003. Aluminium and Agri - clear leaders \"In Aluminium we are creating a world-class company. We are aiming for a leading global position and can report good progress in improvements and cost reductions so far this year. For 2003 we have raised our ambitions with a further NOK 350 million.\" Regarding Agri, he said that Hydro held a clear, leading international position in the industry, and that the company will direct focus to further production improvements and opportunities that may arise in a further consolidation of the fertilizer industry.

Bech defined Hydro’s People Policy as one of the main tools in developing Hydro’s performance culture. \"We intend to ensure a dynamic and open internal job market relating to positions at all levels of the organization, including senior management jobs,\" she said.

There is now one woman in Hydro’s corporate management, and nine of the people who report to directly to corporate anagement are women compared with none in 1999. During the same period, the average age of corporate management and their closest colleagues has been reduced from 52 to 48. \"The changes have come as a result of a conscious plan to increase diversity in the company and ensure a dynamic senior management,\" Alexandra Bech said.

This acquisition follows an agreement to buy all of the shares in the Aldbrough Gas Storage Company Ltd from Intergen, a company owned jointly by Shell and Bechtel . The new facility will act as a buffer against possible terminal interruptions, and will provide additional security of supply for Statoil’s gas deliveries to the UK market. In addition, the facility's rapid injection and withdrawal capability will support the group's UK gas trading activities. A total of three underground salt caverns are to be prepared to receive 170-230 million cubic metres (six-eight billion cubic feet) of gas.

       " 'Visund: A \\'green\\' platform Hydro has started water injection on the Visund field. Hydro now operates four platforms - Oseberg Sør, Oseberg Øst, Snorre B og Visund - with full reinjection of produced water, waste water and cuttings \"Produced water is reinjected in a well and used as pressure in the reservoir. On the other wells on Visund, gas will continue to be used to force out oil and gas deposits,\" says Arnleiv Dale, leader of the Visund unit. Stone, gravel and sludge containing oil residues - as well as waste water - will be returned to beneath the seabed. Use of chemicals is reduced, and emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are much lower than usual. Less water than expected Since Visund was first put into operation, the wells have produced less water than originally expected. Therefore, there has been too little water to process for the installed pump capacity on the platform. Processed water has been emitted to the sea, but measurements show that the content of oil residues is far below the limits of 40 parts per million set by Norwegian authorities. \"We have produced so litte water on Visund that it has not been possible to reinject it. Emissions have therefore also been very limited and well within Hydro\\'s own standards as well as external standards,\" says Dale. Other wells, including two recently put into production on Visund North, now produce enough water that the pumps are well supplied. Gas as pressure The Visund project has carried out a research program in cooperation with Hydro\\'s research center in Bergen on the use of gas as pressure instead of water. \"This gave good results, and we decided to use gas instead of water, in that the water volume was low. We also considered using water from a reservoir in the Utsire formation, but that was not realized because of technical and geological reasons,\" says Dale. \\'Green\\' platform Hydro wanted Visund to be a \"green\" platform. When water reinjection becomes a reality, emissions of process water will be reduced to a minimum. The project is a milestone for the field, which is 27 kilometers northeast of Gullfaks. Visund was developed with a floating drilling, processing and accommodation platform. The field produces on average 48,000 barrels per day. Development of gas resources has started and exports of gas are to begin around 2005. Subsea development on Visund North began production in February 2002. Hydro has started water injection on the Visund field.

Use of chemicals is reduced, and emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are much lower than usual. Less water than expected Since Visund was first put into operation, the wells have produced less water than originally expected. Therefore, there has been too little water to process for the installed pump capacity on the platform. Processed water has been emitted to the sea, but measurements show that the content of oil residues is far below the limits of 40 parts per million set by Norwegian authorities. \"We have produced so litte water on Visund that it has not been possible to reinject it. Emissions have therefore also been very limited and well within Hydro\\'s own standards as well as external standards,\" says Dale. Other wells, including two recently put into production on Visund North, now produce enough water that the pumps are well supplied. Gas as pressure The Visund project has carried out a research program in cooperation with Hydro\\'s research center in Bergen on the use of gas as pressure instead of water. \"This gave good results, and we decided to use gas instead of water, in that the water volume was low. We also considered using water from a reservoir in the Utsire formation, but that was not realized because of technical and geological reasons,\" says Dale. \\'Green\\' platform Hydro wanted Visund to be a \"green\" platform. When water reinjection becomes a reality, emissions of process water will be reduced to a minimum. The project is a milestone for the field, which is 27 kilometers northeast of Gullfaks. Visund was developed with a floating drilling, processing and accommodation platform. The field produces on average 48,000 barrels per day. Development of gas resources has started and exports of gas are to begin around 2005. Subsea development on Visund North began production in February 2002.',\n",
       " 'Worming away drilling waste New approaches – including earthworm composting and asphalt production – are being pursued by Statoil in its search for good ways to treat drilling waste. The group can already reuse some 67 per cent of oil-based drilling fluids and 50 per cent of water-based fluids. Its total fluid management (TFM) project aims to help enhance value creation, in part by developing effective techniques for removing and reusing drill cuttings and drilling fluids. “We must expect discharge curbs to become ever stricter in coming years,” says project manager John Eirik Paulsen. “The TFM team is working to develop good environmental strategies and methods for reducing the problems posed by various types of waste from drilling and downhole operations.” Recycling these materials so that none needs to be deposited as hazardous waste is the most attractive option. The TFM project has already managed to reduce their volume considerably. Trials are currently under way at Norway’s Jordforsk research institute with earthworm composting of oily drill cuttings. The worms are fed on cuttings and liquid mixed with animal waste, and convert the blend to a good fertilising compost. In addition, Statoil has joined forces with Norwegian road surfacing specialist Veidekke to carry out trials on using oily cuttings for asphalt production. “We find this interesting,” says Mr Paulsen. “Tests have not encountered gasification or other environmental problems, the asphalt is hardwearing and we have no residual waste.” Drilling waste brought ashore accounts for roughly 60 per cent of the total cost of treating waste on land, including materials from Statoil’s land-based plants.

Some 200 employees and guests from the community were welcomed by factory manager Bodo Götschel. \"We can be proud of this event... and I am increasingly satisfied with the progress of the HIV/AIDS program,\" Götschel said - in reference to the internal exchange endeavor started between Hydro and Norwegian NGO, Fredskorps, in summer 2001. \"Attendance by both employees and management was impressive... the event, especially the theatre piece (by Hecate Theatre Company of Johannesburg) captivated the audience,\" he remarked. \"The complicated matter of HIV/AIDS came through - know your status.\" Raising awareness \"Our goal is to increase awareness among employees about HIV/AIDS, hopefully reducing its spread among personnel and their families,\" said Kynoch HIV/AIDS Program Coordinator Audrey Stark, who arrived in April 2002 as part of the Hydro/Fredskorps exchange. In the southern region of the Northwest Province in South Africa, where the Kynoch factory is located, some one-third of inhabitants are infected with HIV. The local newspaper Potchefstroom Herald reports that the figure has not yet stabilized - meaning infections are still rising. In the Sub-Saharan region of Africa, some 29.4 million adults are infected with HIV, according to a new UNAIDS and World Health Organization update. The adult prevalence rate in the region is 8.8 percent, some 58 percent of which are women. \"Yet, there are new, hopeful signs that the epidemic could eventually be brought under control,\" the report claims. \"Positive trends seem to be taking hold among younger people in a number of countries. In South Africa, for pregnant women under 20, HIV prevalence rates fell to 15.4% in 2001 (down from 21% in 1998).\" Globally, the number of people living with HIV today has risen to 42 million, up from 40 million at the end of 2001. Five million people were newly-infected and 3.1 million people were killed by the disease in 2002. Motivating people \"Our guest speaker on AIDS Day was popular former soccer player Phil Masinga who played on one of this area\\'s favorite teams and later in Europe,\" Stark remarked. Masinga, who scored the winning goal that took South Africa to the World Cup in 1998, \"delivered a motivational speech about AIDS awareness and encouraged people to know their HIV status.\" The event also presented a quiz show in which employees competed for the first prize - a trophy and restaurant voucher - by answering questions about HIV/AIDS. AIDS Day also featured a candle lighting ceremony led by the Tshepong AIDS Project - \"The local LoveLife Franchise,\" a speech by managing director Doug McCullouch, and concluded with the theatre piece entitled \"Live On, Live Long.\" Kynoch employees also received an AIDS pin and golf shirts designed by the Kynoch HIV/AIDS task team, which incoporate the UNAIDS slogan, \"Live and let live.\" Helping hand \"We want to help prolong the lives of employees and improve their quality of life,\" Stark commented. \"We\\'re trying to generate openness about the illness and to reduce the stigmatization of those already infected.\" Kynoch will start providing voluntary HIV/AIDS counseling and testing for its 400 employees in December.

       " 'Wildcat spudded on Blåmeis The first exploration well on Statoil’s Blåmeis prospect in the Norwegian Sea was spudded on 26 November by Stena Don , and is expected to take about a month to complete. This structure is thought to contain oil, reports Knut Chr Grindstad, exploration vice president for the Halten/Nordland cluster in the north Norwegian port of Harstad. Blåmeis is close to the group’s existing Norne field, in an area where Statoil has already found oil in a series of structures named after birds – Stær (Starling), Falk (Falcon) and Svale (Swallow). None of these discoveries is large enough to support a stand-alone development. Statoil is accordingly considering various options, which include coming up with technology that could make it easier to tie back small finds to Norne’s production ship. Developing these discoveries as a cluster will also improve their economics. The Norne vessel is due to go off plateau in 2003, and needs additional oil to maintain production levels. Great expectations are attached to the Blåmeis wildcat. Mr Grindstad says that a possible oil discovery could also be tied back to Norne. Should the most optimistic hopes be borne out by the well, however, the field could become a stand-alone development. Possible Blåmeis oil is expected to be heavier than Norne crude, but this will not be known until drilling has been completed and its results analysed. Plans call for the well to be drilled to a depth of about 2,000 metres.

The well path passes through a Brent formation prospect – parts of which lie more than 2,500 metres below sea level – in the form of a curve. After initially descending vertically, it angles out, becomes gently horizontal and then ascends at an angle of 106 degrees. This approach is not unusual for production wells, but the Dolly wildcat is one of the first exploration wells drilled by Statoil to use the method. The group utilised a Powerdrive drilling machine developed by Anadrill Schlumberger for the operation. Computer controlled, this unit can drill longer stretches at a time and thereby reduces the time required. It has previously been deployed by Statoil on some of its North Sea fields. “Viewed purely in terms of drilling technology, it’s all the same whether you’re drilling a producer or a wildcat,” explains Bengt Beskow, exploration manager for the Tampen area in Exploration & Production Norway. “When we’re looking for supplementary oil on the fringes of mature fields, in satellites or in new areas like the Dolly prospect, however, we must try to rationalise drilling operations.” He notes that two other recent Statoil exploration wells, in the Ole and Dole structures west of Gullfaks satellite Rimfaks, utilised new methods.

A \"poor\" well The well in question, E-6, was originally completed in 1997. But production was poor, and the decision was taken to drill again in 2000, partly on the basis of 4D seismic data. Last autumn, after further seismic studies, it was decided to add an additional branch to the well, a branch that would go into an undrilled area in the opposite direction of the branch that had already been agreed. The decision to drill an extra horizontal branch in a previously unexplored area, was considerably easier as the new branch technology made exploration drilling far less costly than it would have been with conventional technology. It took only 10 months from decision to drilling. The geological results in both the horizontal wells were better than expected, and it was decided that they should be extended so that the distance from toe to toe is now a remarkable 4.8 kilometers.

World leader in electrolysers In additional to its domestic activities, Hydro also collaborates with several other players in the hydrogen sector through international projects. \"Hydro is the world leader in electrolysers for local production of hydrogen. Through the further development of electrolysers, which so far have mainly been used for industrial purposes, we have created the \"gas stations of the future\". During the course of the next half year we shall deliver filling stations for hydrogen as fuel for buses - both in Reykjavik and Hamburg. \"These cities are taking part in EU supported projects to test hydrogen as fuel. We have shown that we have both breadth and depth in our hydrogen activities,\" says Myrberg. Hydro\\'s hydrogen focus has increased in the last few years through an evaluation of market opportunities and political signals. The Utsira project, which was Hydro\\'s initiative, is one example of a flexible energy supply project where hydrogen plays a key role. \"Hydro has expertise in gas and electricity that can be used for production of hydrogen, and we can supply natural gas once the market is ready for large scale hydrogen production,\" says Myrberg. Major energy challenges There are major global challenges for energy consumption, especially within the OECD, which has limited resources particularly with regard to oil and gas. Being able to secure energy resources from alternative sources is essential for economic development, while it is at the same time important to steer energy consumption so that global, regional and local emissions can be avoided. The worldwide demand for primary energy is expected to have increased by around 66 percent in 2030, and the OECD recognizes that less and less of this energy will be produced in the OECD countries. Hydrogen can be produced from several different sources, including renewable sources, and is therefore a good energy carrier for meeting the world\\'s increased energy needs.

       " \"Hectic final sprint on Tune In connection with the company's energy seminar in Bergen on 7 November, Hydro and partners were able to celebrate the completion of the Tune gas and condensate field. Tune, situated ten kilometers southwest of Oseberg, will significantly boost the development of Hydro's gas portfolio and improve resource utilization in the Oseberg area. The Tune development consists of a template with four wells linked to the Oseberg Field Center. The field's total reserves run to 27 billion cubic meters gas and seven million cubic meters of condensate. Tune, due to come on stream in November 2002, will initially produce three billion cubic meters of gas annually. These volumes will be used for injection on Oseberg and will therefore liberate greater amounts of that field's gas for export. This will contribute to more optimal resource utilization on Oseberg. The development of the Tune subsea installation and the modifications to the Oseberg Field Center cost less than estimated and were completed on schedule. The Tune partnership decided originally to lay chromium-steel pipelines between Tune and Oseberg. The goal was to reduce the use of anti-corrosive chemicals and the resulting environmental impact of the project. Because of leakages, the partners resolved in July 2002 to switch to carbon steel pipelines and replacement work was completed in less than three months. It was, however, not been possible to complete the work by the scheduled start-up date, 1 October. The gas will be piped via Oseberg Gasstransport to Heimdal and then on the UK and the continent. Tune was discovered by Hydro in 1995 and the development plan for the field approved in 1999.

And there\\'s no time to lose,\" said President and CEO Eivind Reiten at Hydro\\'s annual energy seminar in Bergen on Thursday. In his speech, Reiten stressed how political will and a strong determination to act are vital if petroleum activity on the Norwegian continental shelf is not to simply wither away over the next 50 years: \"The era of major discoveries is no more. In recent years discoveries have been fewer and smaller. In addition, recent exploration results reveal a disappointing trend with a success rate of just 14 percent. It is in fact the case that no oil has been produced from licenses allocated in Norway after 1986. This is the reality we now have to face up to,\" said Reiten to the roughly 200 representatives from the industry, the government authorities and the media. Steensnæs: sustainability is the key Petroleum and energy minister Einar Steensnæs pointed out that the basis for the government\\'s continued oil and gas policy is one of co-existence: \"Fossil energy sources will be dominant for a long time ahead. The challenge is to produce and use them in the most enironmentally way possible. The Norwegian shelf plays a leading role environmentally, but there\\'s still room for improvement. This is the fundamental condition for the continued development of the shelf,\" he stated. Steensnæs\\' point of view sums up the government\\'s licensing policy, which aims to allocate new exploration acreage to an extent and schedule that promotes the stable and cost-efficient discovery, development and production of new resources. Petroleum-free zones? In connection with the announcement of the 17th licensing round on the Norwegian shelf, more stringent environmental requirements were set for areas considered to be especially vulnerable, environmentally speaking. In addition, impact assessment studies were initiated for petroleum recovery in the Barents Sea and in the area off the Lofoten Islands. \"This impact study will give us a better basis for assessing continued operations in an area that is environmentally sensitive. Zero discharges form a basic requirement here. Moreover, we shall consider establishing petroleum-free zones if it appears impossible to achieve co-existence between petroleum and fishery activities,\" added Steensnæs. The government\\'s impact study will form the basis of an overall plan. This will again draw up the contours for considering petroleum-free zones. \"If everything goes according to plan, the report will be completed in 2005. It might take longer, but it might even be completed earlier than expected,\" he summed up. \"Concerned about the time taken\" Reiten left no doubt that petroleum-free zones will make it considerably more difficult to achieve the government\\'s goal of continued growth on the Norwegian shelf up to 2050, as laid down in white paper no. 38: \"I accept that the authorities need to look in to this, but I am concerned about the time taken. It can lead to the petroleum industry being the victim of a lack of political constancy. It is imperative that the authorities realize that it takes many years, from the time a field is allocated, until it can start producing. Nevertheless, there is no intention of our moving into areas before we are sure that we can co-exist with society\\'s other important industries and interests,\" he stated. A long-term development scenario for the Norwegian shelf was recently launched, as one of two possible future trends, by the government. It reveals a trend on the shelf that might provide additional wealth creation of roughly NOK 2,000 billion between now and 2050. Reiten pointed out that it will be difficult to fulfill this trend, if prospective areas are closed for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves. \"If society decides to go down this route, it will be difficult to achieve the long-term development scenario. We have great opportunities for continued growth by adopting measures to avoid a dramatic fall in production. A good example of this is the amended tax regime on the UK shelf in the mid-1980s, which led to much greater exploration activity and the development of smaller fields,\" said Reiten. \"We have great opportunities for further growth on the Norwegian shelf, but they require that the government gives us a dependable political framework to operate in.

The Conference took place on Tuesday and Wednesday at Folkets Hus in Oslo, which was packed with representatives from both the authorities and industry, among them Hydro\\'s Tore Torvund. \"We\\'ve passed the peak\" Torvund pointed out in his speech that the oil production peak on the Norwegian continental shelf had in fact been passed. \"This is a milestone that requires us to adopt new measures. It is clear that the state has most to gain here, taking as it does up to 90 percent of shelf revenues. Greater value creation, by means of the goal set in white paper no. 38, will not be possible to achieve without significantly amending the main parameters and promoting a positive interplay between the parties involved,\" said Torvund to the approximately 200 participants on the conference\\'s first day. In its white paper no. 38, the Norwegian government directs its focus to the remaining recovery potential for petroleum and gas on the Norwegian shelf in the years ahead. The paper outlines two possible scenarios for the petroleum industry: The long-term development scenario is based on continued growth on the Norwegian continental shelf for the next 50 years. The depletion scenario reveals how oil and gas prodution on the shelf can stagnate more rapidly than necessary. The differences between these two scenarios may in fact represent NOK 2,000 billion in extra revenues. Such an amount will naturally have major consequences for all participants in the Norwegian oil industry, and not least for Norway itself. \"Look to the UK\" Torvund pointed out that the allocation of new exploration acreage, increased recovery rates, new technology, new working methods and new participants are important contributions to achieving the long-term goal set by the government. Nevertheless, he is convinced that a new tax regime is one of the most important factors in stumulating further growth on the shelf. \"A total reworking of the tax regime for the petroleum industry can help to bring about a higher rate of recovery, attract new entrants to the shelf and promote the internationalisation of the petroleum cluster on the Norwegian shelf. And these developments are vital if the government is to achieve its goal. Just look at the greater activity on the British shelf around 1985, as the result of adjusting the tax regime to the prevailing situation,\" he said. Oil production on the Norwegian continental shelf has passed its peak. \"Both the industry and the authorities now have to adopt new measures for continued growth,\" said Tore Torvund, executive vice president for Oil and Energy in Norsk Hydro, at a conference in Oslo on Tuesday.

       " 'Checking helicopters All Super Puma L2 helicopters flying to and from Norwegian fields operated by Statoil have been grounded for technical checks. That follows an incident earlier today, 5 November, when a machine of this type had to make a controlled emergency landing on a tanker. A preliminary inspection of the helicopter concerned has revealed substantial damage to a main rotor blade, reports Thormod Hope, Statoil’s air transport vice president. This appears to have been caused by a pendulum weight in the rotor head, which came loose and hit the blade. But it is too early to say anything specific about why that happened. “In consultation with operator Norsk Helikopter, we’ve resolved to check the rotor system on all machines of this type flying to and from our fields,” says Mr Hope. “This means that seven helicopters will be grounded for about 24 hours.” That corresponds to half the fleet used to fly personnel to and from Statoil’s Norwegian fields, causing delays to crew.

       " 'New Norwegian discoveries A good exploration season has been recorded by Statoil on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) so far this year. The group recently proved more oil and gas in the Tyrihans South discovery in the Norwegian Sea and found oil in the Dolly prospect in the Tampen area of the North Sea. Being drilled by Stena Don to a depth of 4,000 metres, the Tyrihans South appraisal well is currently being logged. “At the moment, it looks as if our optimistic estimates have been confirmed, but we’ll know more when the data have been gathered,” says Knut Chr Grindstad. As exploration vice president for the Halten/Nordland business cluster in the north Norwegian town of Harstad, he characterised the results of the well as gratifying. The additional resources proven add substantially to total reserves in the Tyrihans South and North fields. “We need a number of such discoveries in future to keep our processing facilities fully occupied and to continue developing the area,” says Mr Grindstad. Tyrihans is regarded as a satellite to Statoil’s producing Åsgard field. A natural development approach would accordingly be a direct subsea tie-in with the existing infrastructure on Åsgard, once the basis for possible production has been clarified. Mr Grindstad is very satisfied with the new Stena Don rig, which includes dynamic positioning among its capabilities. The other discovery was made with exploration well 34/10-47S in the Dolly prospect, which lies north of Gullfaks satellites Rimfaks and Gullveig. Deepsea Trym recently completed the first section of the well, five kilometres from Gullveig. The results of an extensive logging and coring programme are now being evaluated. Hydrocarbons were also proven earlier this year in two structures – 33/9-8A Ole and 33/9-8S Dole – west of Rimfaks. “These are positive results,” says Reidar Helland, manager of the Gullfaks resource development department. “Possible solutions for development as supplementary resources to the major Tampen area fields will be evaluated during the winter.” A good exploration season has been recorded by Statoil on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) so far this year.

       " 'Oil production towards new heights In recent months, Hydro has set several new records in oil and gas production. Hydro is on the way to become a 500,000 barrel oil company. Last week the company produced 533,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, 60,000 barrels of which were produced on fields outside of the Norwegian continental shelf. Increasing oil production in the second half of the year has led to an upward adjustment of forecast annual production by 15,000 barrels per day to 470,000. Hydro expects to maintain a production level of around 500,000 barrels oil equivalents per day in the fourth quarter. This is 40,000 barrels more per day than the average production level in the first three quarters of the year. \"The high production is a result of very great demand for gas from customers on the continent. In addition, the fields that were closed down for maintenance earlier this autumn are now in production again,\" says Kjetil Solbrække, Vice President Finance in Oil and Energy. \"We also notice a gain from the SDFI units we purchased in May, which increase our ownership in the Oseberg fields,\" he says. Hydro’s present production record was set in the middle of July, when daily production was as high as 541,000 barrels. Meanwhile Solbrække does not rule out the possibility that this record may be broken later this year. Important factors would include the demand for gas staying at the forecast level – around 140 barrels oil equivalents – and that the Tune field in North Sea comes onstream as planned.

       " 'Norwegian government welcomes Grenland location of gas innovation center In its white paper on the gas sector published today, Friday 1 November, the Norwegian government welcomes Hydros initiative to establish a national center for gas research and technology development in the Grenland region. \"This is great news for developing the market for the industrial use of gas in Norway,\" says Hilde Tonne, head of department in Hydro Energy. \"Hydro has worked to unite the main gas research and technology development participants in a concerted action at national level. The government is now making funds available. We are looking forward to further backing for the project and more detail once it has been discussed in the Norwegian parliament,\" she adds. It was at Hydro’s energy seminar in Bergen last year that President and CEO Eivind Reiten launched his proposal to establish a national gas innovation center in Grenland. The proposal was viewed in the context of the challenges facing Norway in terms of international environmental commitments, the competitiveness of Norwegian industry, the energy balance and, not least, securing the value of the country’s natural resources. The government sees Hydro’s initiative to set up an industry driven gas innovation center as a positive step, and believes that it will become a significant factor in the drive to promote technology development and commercial solutions in the gas sector. \"The Grenland location of such a center is the correct one for several reasons,\" says Hilde Tonne. \"The region already constitutes an extensive industrial cluster, and is an important joint location for industry and a considerable research environment. Moreover, the location is ideal from the point of view of using the gas in the most populous areas of Norway,\" says Tonne who was in charge Hydro’s preparations for the innovation center. Boosting gas technology development paves the way for the further development of existing industry, new sustainable activity and, in addition, new opportunities for specialist suppliers. During the past year, Hydro has discussed the setting up of an innovation center with a number of major interests. The center will, by accessing a network of commercial users, suppliers and specialists, be able to benefit from the facilities and expertise of Norway’s R&D milieus rather than compete with them. It will, instead, make better use of them. Synergy effects and economies of scale are anticipated by means of greater cooperation between participants and the running of a greater number of technology projects. \"It is important that the center is made a national one to achieve the appropriate position of influence. We are hoping that this will be the outcome of the parliamentary process to be completed in March or April of next year,\" says Tonne. As part of the process to develop Grenland into a central gas technology location, the government further proposes that a state agency for environmentally friendly gas technology, or state-run innovation company, be located in the region. That such a company be placed close to industry’s innovation center for gas, was described as advantageous in the white paper, and will provide a boost for the overall national gas program. \"This is in line with our recommendation for a state-run innovation company to distribute funds to promote gas technology development and innovation,\" says vice president Elizabeth Baumann Ofstad in Hydro Energy. She was a member of the publicly appointed gas technology committee that will submit its report to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in March 2002. \"The funds the government are now announcing fall far short of what the committee considered necessary for the desired development.

This agreement reflects Statoil’s strategy to expand its international upstream activities. In this process, Statoil has over the past two years opened new offices in Brazil, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and in Iran. The agreement on South Pars phases six, seven and eight represents the group’s first development contract in the Middle East. This new activity is in line with Norwegian foreign policy, which encourages increased trade relations with Iran. Work is due to take place over the next four years, and Statoil’s capital commitment over that period will amount to USD 300 million. The agreement will take effect before 10 November, when Statoil takes over the operatorship. Statoil's capital commitment and return will be covered from sales revenues generated by condensate and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) produced over a four-year period from the start of production – which will be in late 2004 under current plans. Statoil regards this as an attractive and robust project. The field will be developed with three offshore wellhead platforms linked by the same number of pipelines to a land-based gas treatment plant. Production capacity will be 100 million standard cubic metres per day, with 80 million standard cubic metres of gas daily being exported to other Iranian oil fields for injection as pressure support. The remaining condensate and LPG will be sold. Petropars will act as operator of the development project for the land-based gas treatment facilities. Established in 1998, Petropars is involved in six of the first 10 phases awarded for the development of the giant South Pars offshore gas field, as either partner or operator.

Chief executive Olav Fjell was presented with the certificate on 24 October by Miklos Konkoly-Thege, head of classification society Det Norske Veritas (DNV). Mr Fjell observed at the presentation that Statoil had devoted substantial resources since 1998 to cleaning up and improving the efficiency of its management system and governing documents. Pursued at both corporate and business area level, this work had resulted in considerable simplifications. “Even with in-house incentives, it’s useful to have an external body which monitors that we’re implementing the system we’ve now established, that we’re setting targets which are followed up and that we’re executing improvement processes,” Mr Fjell added. Statoil has resolved that all central operational entities will certify their part of the governing system in accordance with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 or both. Several units within the Manufacturing & Marketing and International Exploration & Production business areas have already achieved such certification. The goal is to have all the other units certified by the end of 2004. “We’re in a phase of strong internationalisation,” Mr Fjell observed. “So it’s important to have received both in-house and external confirmation that our governing system equips us to deliver what we’ve promised.” Mr Konkoly-Thege said that the certification job had left DNV impressed at the dynamism and vigour of Statoil’s large organisation.

Den direkte kritikken kommer overraskende og på et dårlig tidspunkt, hevder hun. Hydro og Statoil har flest operasjoner på sokkelen og følgelig har de den største mengden produsert vann - vann som som finnes naturlig i oljereservoarene og som pumpes opp fra berggrunnen sammen med olje og gass. Eldre olje- og gassfelt, som produserer større mengder vann, har ført til at utslipp av produsert vann har økt med om lag 20 prosent hvert år, ifølge SFT. For selskapene vil det være svært dyrt å gjøre noe med utslippene, det er nok noe av grunnen til at noen av selskapene ennå ikke har tatt beslutninger som vil bringe utslippene ned, sa Marie Nordby, avdelingsdirektør i SFT, til NRK tirsdag kveld. Forskjellige typer teknologi - Hydro arbeider med forskjellige typer teknologi for å redusere innholdet av miljøfarlige stoffer i produsert vann, for å redusere bruk av produksjonskjemikalier og for en fullstendig utfasing av noen miljøfarlige kjemikalier, forklarer Toril Røe Utvik, HMS-leder i Utforsking og Produksjon Norge. - Vi har allerede tatt i bruk ny teknologi som reduserer utslipp av olje i produsert vann på flere plattformer, og vurderer teknologi som bruker kondensat fra plattformer for å trekke ut oppløste oljekomponenter fra utslipp av produsert vann. En annen mulighet som vurderes er å reinjisere produsert vann i reservoarene. Reinjisering brukes allerede på seks av våre 12 plattformer, sier hun. Undervannsanlegget Troll Pilot - som skiller ut vann fra olje og gass og sender det tilbake til reservoaret - er et godt eksempel på Hydros aktive tiltak, bemerker Norheim. - Vi har hatt ett års vellykket drift med Troll Pilot, og vi ser på denne teknologien som forløperen for \"usynlige\" plattformer som vil bli plassert på havbunnen i framtiden. - SFTs uttalelser om vår manglende vilje til å iverksette tiltak for å redusere miljøfarlige utslipp av produsert vann er villedende, både med tanke på hva vi har gjort og den prosessen vi har startet i samarbeid med SFT, sier informasjonsdirektør Hege Marie Norheim i Hydro Olje & Energi. Hydro arbeider aktivt med å redusere utslipp av produsert vann fra oljeplattformer på den norske sokkelen - og avviser bestemt SFTs påstand om at Hydro kanskje mangler vilje til å bringe utslippene ned. I 1997 vedtok myndighetene en lov som sier at alle oljeselskaper i Norge skal levere en omfattende plan innen juni 2003 som beskriver hvordan de skal nå kravet om null miljøfarlige utslipp innen 2005.

       " 'SFT criticism doesn\\'t reflect Hydro efforts \"SFT\\'s comments about our will to implement measures on produced water discharges is misleading both in regards to what we have done and to the momentum of the current process we\\'ve started in co-operation with SFT,\" says Hydro Oil & Energy information director Hege Marie Norheim. Hydro actively works to reduce discharges of produced water from petroleum platforms in the Norwegian offshore sector - and adamantly rejects the Norwegian Pollution Control Authority (SFT) assertion that Hydro may \"lack the will to get discharges down.\" A law passed in 1997 by the Norwegian Parliament mandates all oil companies operating in Norway to submit a comprehensive plan in June 2003 for how they will reach zero harmful discharges by 2005. Hydro is preparing such a plan for its platforms in the Norwegian offshore sector. \"The plan is supposed to be submitted eight months from now... SFT itself determined that. Hydro has met with SFT all along and we\\'ve not been given any reason to believe they were dissatisfied with our work so far. The criticism is surprising, blunt and badly timed,\" she asserts. Hydro and Statoil count the highest number of offshore operations and subsequently have the highest volumes of produced water - residual water after oil and gas production which occurs naturally in subterranean petroleum reservoirs. Aging oil and gas operations - which produce comparatively higher volumes of water - has caused produced water discharges to rise an estimated 20 percent per year, according to SFT. \"It will be extremely expensive for the companies to do something about discharges, which is enough of a reason some companies haven\\'t yet determined how to bring discharges down,\" said SFT petroleum activities sector chief Marie Nordy on Norway\\'s national broadcast network NRK Tuesday night. Different technologies \"Hydro is working with different technologies for reducing harmful natural compounds from produced water discharges, as well as reducing production chemical use and completely phasing out some harmful chemicals,\" explains Toril Røe Utvik, environmental section head in Hydro Exploration and Production Norway. \"We have already implemented new technology which reduces discharges of oil with produced water on several platforms and are evaluating technology that uses condensate from platforms to extract dissolved oil components from produced water discharges.\" Another option studied is reinjecting produced water back into the reservoir. \"Reinjection technology is already implemented on six of our 12 platforms,\" she says. The subsea Troll Pilot system on the Troll field - which separates water from oil and gas and sends it back into the reservoir - is a good example of Hydro\\'s proactive efforts, remarks Norheim. \"We\\'ve had one year of great success with Troll Pilot and see this technology as a forerunner for \\'invisible\\' platforms placed on the seabed in the future.\" Smart well advantage \"Hydro has a big advantage rarely mentioned regarding the zero discharge goal in 2005 - smart well technology,\" says Ruben Schulkes, section leader at Hydro\\'s Oil & Energy Research Center in Porsgrunn. \"This is a technology where we equip our wells with sensors and valves.

Norsk Hydro has now completed an extensive evaluation of prospects for the company's Block 34 licence in Angola. Two further exploration wells in other parts of the 6,000 sq.km area are planned, but the company has decided to expense the remaining part of previously capitalized costs of acquiring the licence rights. This will give rise to a charge of NOK 480 million. The third exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, Spa, has been concluded without a discovery being made. A charge of roughly NOK 300 million will be made for this, including the previously capitalized costs of acquiring the licence rights. Although a discovery was made in the Svane well on the Danish shelf, this is not considered commercial and NOK 140 million will be expensed during the quarter. Altogether, exploration costs of some NOK 1.3 billion will be charged to Hydro's results in the third quarter. The quarterly results for Aluminium will be affected by weak market conditions and a continued fall in aluminium prices during the quarter. In addition, there will be an unrealized currency loss of NOK 380 million relating to the associated company Alunorte in Brazil.

       " 'Cleaner on Kvitebjørn The Kvitebjørn gas field operated by Statoil in the Norwegian North Sea will produce without harmful discharges to the sea and with record-low emissions of carbon dioxide. “This reservoir features very high temperature and pressure,” observes Kvitebjørn project director Bjarne Bakken. “By exploiting these forces, we can cut energy consumption on the field and thereby substantially reduce emissions to the air and discharges to the sea.” Gas production can be piped to land with the aid of reservoir energy because its pressure will be reduced as little as possible during the separation process prior to export. Similarly, the wellstream temperature will be tapped to process condensate (light oil) and eliminate the need for a separate heat medium in the platform’s processing facilities. These measures will keep emissions of nitrogen oxides as low as 0.02 kilograms per cubic metre of gas/oil produced and carbon dioxide released at 16 kilograms per unit produced. That compares with average Norwegian offshore emission ceilings of 0.12 kilograms for nitrogen oxides and 52 kilograms for carbon dioxide set in the official Miljøsok environmental study. Produced water and drill cuttings are to be pumped back below ground with the aid of reservoir pressure, eliminating harmful discharges to the sea and reducing emissions to the air. The quality of materials on the Kvitebjørn platform is uniformly high. That enhances safety and cuts maintenance, while the reduced need for corrosion inhibitors also provides an environmental gain. “Environmental measures adopted on this field are in line with Statoil’s objective of producing oil and gas without harmful emissions or discharges,” says Mr Bakken.

Hydro Energy president Hilde Myrberg attended the first meeting, hosted by European Commission president Romano Prodi and Commission vice president Loyola de Palacio, in charge of EU energy and transport policy. \"Participation in the high level group - which traverses the entire value chain - is important for us in light of our extensive efforts developing hydrogen as an energy carrier,\" said Myrberg. \"The first meeting was symbolic in designating a joint European hydrogen agenda. A healthy balance of optimism and pragmatism was conveyed with respect to the pace of development.\" The group includes top-tier representatives from several major EU auto and energy companies, public utilities, research institutes, transport concerns and policy makers. They will collectively assess the potential benefits of using hydrogen and fuel cells in EU transport, energy production and many other areas - and help pave the way for more focused EU action in this field, the Commission said in a statement. Initial results are expected by mid-2003 - when a \"foresight report\" is presented. The document will include a hydrogen and fuel cell research agenda, as well as deployment and commercialization actions, taking into account such issues as innovation, marketing, distribution and infrastructure, safety, public/private partnerships and investments in the hydrogen sector. \"Despite expressed recognition of a long transition period (from fossil fuels to hydrogen), the wish among meeting participants to set clear objectives for a hydrogen future is promising... with respect to the possibility of making a coordinated and realistic action plan,\" Myrberg commented. \"Hydro\\'s particpation in the planned working groups will enable us to contribute to a focused European agenda with our developed knowledge and expertise. It\\'s a welcome opportunity to be on the inside of such a development.\" Towards a hydrogen-based economy \"This is an important choice for Europe,\" said Prodi. \"Hydrogen technology will not only reduce our energy dependency and gas emissions, it will considerably change our socio-economic model and create new opportunities for developing countries in the long run.\" Global demand for electricity is expected to double by 2015. Hydrogen will eventually contribute substantially to clean transport and power generation: its only emission is water vapor. But to enable us to move from today\\'s largely fossil fuel based energy economy to a more hydrogen-based one we need more research, know-how and investment, the Commission stated. The high level group will assess progress so far and help devise short-term actions to introduce hydrogen to the market and prepare a long-term hydrogen and fuel cell strategy at EU level. \"I am looking for new and original ways to reduce the European Union\\'s dependence on oil while at the same time contributing to sustainable development,\" said de Palacio. \"Hydrogen and fuel cells offer such a possibility and they can contribute significantly to our policy objective of replacing 20% of automotive fuel with alternative fuels by 2020.

       " 'Green power from Iceland Opportunities for exporting geothermal electricity from Iceland to Norway, the UK or both of these countries are being studied by Statoil. The group recently signed a letter of intent with Norwegian grid operator Statnett and Iceland’s Landsvirkjun on producing a feasibility study for a 600 MW power station by next spring. “We’re considering this because of our desire to participate in renewable energy projects where we have relevant expertise,” says Hanne Lekva, head of the new energy business development unit. Geothermal heat from 1-2,000 metres below ground will be brought to the surface to drive turbines, which in turn run electricity generators. A station would be able to generate about five terawatt-hours per year, which corresponds to four-five per cent of Norway’s annual hydropower output. If the plans are implemented, the required submarine power cable will be 1,200 kilometres long – but the energy loss over this distance is only about six per cent. Preliminary assessments show that the project can compete with other types of renewable energy. But geothermal power from Iceland is not competitive at today’s electricity prices. “Our commitment is based on a growth in ‘green certificates’,” says Lekva. “We believe this type of electricity will be commercially attractive in the rather longer term.” A growing number of European countries are demanding that electricity suppliers sell a certain amount of renewable energy.

       " 'More inclusion in focus Today, 2 October, chief executive Olav Fjell spoke about Statoil’s challenges and experiences regarding a more inclusive workplace at a meeting with the Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik. Two hundred key personnel from Norwegian businesses participated in the meeting, where Mr Fjell was one of three business leaders who commented on their company’s experiences. The authorities and companies in the business sector entered into an agreement on creating a more inclusive workplace one year ago. Over 230,000 workers are employed in companies participating in the agreement. These companies commit themselves to following up people on sick leave and adapting the work situation for older people and disabled employees. The objective is to reduce sickness absence by at least 20 per cent in four years. “An inclusive workplace is just as big a challenge for managers. They are the ones who have to readjust and take an active role with their employees, by discussing job satisfaction, working environment and sickness absence,” said Mr Fjell. In 2001, sickness absence in the parent company was 3.4 per cent, while sickness absence in Norway was about 9 per cent. “However, sickness absence varies considerably between the various business areas and professional groups, so there are still challenges to tackle,” added Mr Fjell. In recent years there has been an increase in sickness absence. Statoil’s efforts within local care work have been important in the work of reversing this trend. The group was already in progress with a local care project in the catering sector before the authorities joined in. According to medical director Signy Midtbø Riisnes, those who are excluded from work are the ones most susceptible to illness.

       " 'Gas sales changeover completed The transition to company-based sales of Norwegian offshore gas, which has replaced coordinated contact negotiations, was completed with the start of the new gas year on 1 October. Norway’s gas negotiating and gas supply (GFU/FU) committees ceased to exist in 2001. Each company with gas production is now marketing and administering its own deliveries. The new model will sharpen competition in line with the European Union’s intentions, says Erik Kjos-Hanssen, vice president for gas supply and transport in Natural Gas. This changeover opens new opportunities for Statoil. It can buy sales gas from other offshore players, for instance, or offer back-up services to sellers to secure their delivery commitments. Statoil currently markets and sells both its own entitlement gas and the state’s directly-owned supplies. This corresponds to about 70 per cent of Norwegian production. On the first day of the new gas year, the group sold 109 million cubic metres of gas. Mr Kjos-Hanssen says that the new model means big changes for the producers. Statoil, for instance, used to supply daily information to buyers on behalf of all the sellers. Twenty-two companies hold long-term gas purchase contracts with Statoil, and staff in Natural Gas have done a major job in restructuring all these deals. A number of information meetings have also been held with these customers. As a result of the change, buyers can now negotiate with and order gas from any gas owner they wish. Opportunities for licensees to produce their share of a field’s reserves have been made more flexible, Mr Kjos-Hanssen reports. Previously, each licensee had to lift its fixed share of the gas every day. It can now do this to a greater extent independently of its share.

Presented without intermission, Event consisted of complete dances, excerpts of dances from the repertory and new sequences arranged for the particular performance and place. Stage decor was made by equally famous modern art legend, the painter Robert Rauschenberg, who first collaborated with Cunningham and music composer John Cage in the early 1950s. At the end of the performance, Cunningham navigated center stage with the aid of a crutch and dancer to receive a warm standing ovation. CODA actually premiered this year at Reykjavik City Theatre in Iceland before traveling to Oslo.

       " 'Cleaner heating oil A new heating oil which contains almost 90 per cent less sulphur than existing products is being offered by Statoil to the Norwegian market this autumn. Called Statoil Environmental, this grade will initially be marketed in urban areas. \"It burns more cleanly than conventional heating oil, thus reducing emissions of soot and particulates,\" adds sales vice president Hans Olav Høidahl at Statoil Norge. The new product complements the group\\'s existing Norwegian range, which now comprises three grades - Standard, Plus and Environmental. Statoil is the first oil company in Norway to offer a heating oil which significantly reduces sulphur emissions. These contribute to acid precipitation and local pollution, and can cause respiratory problems. Lower soot formation in the heating system will also mean better oil utilisation and thereby cut consumption, says senior engineer Atle Jørgensen at Statoil\\'s Mongstad refinery. Involved in developing and testing the new product, he notes that work by a number of companies to cut sulphur in diesel oil has also played a part in the launch of Statoil Environmental. \"All in all, this product will help to ensure reliable and economic operation of heating systems, while putting less of a burden on the environment.\" A new heating oil which contains almost 90 per cent less sulphur than existing products is being offered by Statoil to the Norwegian market this autumn.

       " 'Developing sustainable energy A drive to develop business opportunities in sustainable production and renewable energy has been launched by Statoil. Through its recently-established business development unit for new energy, the group is focusing attention on four principal areas. These are renewable energy, energy efficiency, handling of carbon dioxide and hydrogen as an energy bearer. “We’re concentrating on areas where we have expertise and where our profitability requirements are met,” says Hanne Lekva, manager for new energy. Her development unit is responsible for producing wood pellets in Norway, where Statoil ranks as market leader. It has a 66.6 per cent holding in Norsk Trepellets, which owns a plant in Brumunddal north of Oslo. A new plant is due to come on stream at Sykkylven in mid-Norway next summer. Statoil is also involved in producing wood pellets in Sweden and Denmark, and holds 15 per cent of the Scandinavian market. The new energy development unit also has responsibility for the group’s 24.1 per cent interest in Hammerfest Strøm, which is involved in tidal power development in northern Norway. A first prototype of the generating plant is due to be installed in the Kval Sound outside the port of Hammerfest during November. Hammerfest Strøm is developing the technical concept and will market complete tidal power systems. Ms Lekva says that Statoil’s expertise with subsea systems has made a key contribution. In the energy efficiency sector, the development unit will concentrate on micro-power stations through a 48 per cent holding in EC-Power . This company makes complete self-regulating systems. These facilities can generate six to 17 kilowatts of electricity, and have an energy efficiency of more than 90 per cent. “Continental Europe offers relevant market outlets for such micro-power stations,” Ms Lekva notes.

       " 'Drilling on Tyrihans South Statoil spudded an appraisal well on the Tyrihans South find in the Norwegian Sea on 21 September. The Stena Don semi-submersible rig is carrying out the drilling, which is expected to take about one and a half months. “We hope to prove additional oil and gas reserves on Tyrihans South,” reports Knut Christian Grindstad, vice president in the Halten/Nordland exploration unit in Harstad. Gas and oil have already been proven in Tyrihans South and North respectively, in 1983 and 1984. The blocks in which these finds have been proven lie in production licences 073 and 091, and are situated 40 kilometres south of the Åsgard field. Water depth is about 285 metres. The well on Tyrihans South will be drilled to between 3,000 and 4,000 metres depth. “We consider Tyrihans to be an Åsgard satellite, and are contemplating direct subsea tie-back to existing infrastructure on Åsgard,” confirms Mr Grindstad. Timing of the development will depend on available capacity in the infrastructure and the solution chosen for the sale of the gas. Licensees in production licence 091 are operator Statoil with 55 per cent, Norsk Hydro (33) and ExxonMobil (12). Licensees in production licence 073 are operator Statoil with 54.67 per cent, TotalFinaElf (33.33) and Norsk Hydro (12). Stena Don is one of the world’s most modern drilling rigs. Its features include dynamic positioning, which maintains the correct position without the use of anchors. The rig arrived on Tyrihans from an operation on the Statoil operated Norne field. It will also drill the first exploration well on the Blåmeis structure east of the Norne field later this autumn.

       " 'Coiled tubing contract A contract worth some NOK 80-100 million for coiled tubing services on the Norwegian continental shelf has been awarded by Statoil to Schlumberger. This assignment will run for three years, with options for two renewals of two years each. It covers the provision of personnel and equipment for all coiled tubing work on the NCS, other than drilling with coiled tubing and operations from special intervention vessels. Coiled tubing is used primarily for production well workovers and in completing newly-drilled wells. The technique involves running a long tube, normally coiled on a drum, into the well under pressure. This saves time and avoids damaging the reservoir. “Coiled tubing represents a cost-effective way of increasing and maintaining production from our fields,” explains Jan Eric Lode, discipline leader at Statoil for this technology. “The work embraces the use of perforating guns, plugging, logging and workovers.” A contract worth some NOK 80-100 million for coiled tubing services on the Norwegian continental shelf has been awarded by Statoil to Schlumberger.

       " 'First remote well completion The world’s first successful remotely-operated recompletion of a subsea well from a mobile rig has been carried out by Statoil. Deepsea Trym performed the work with I-3 H, an oil producer on the Rimfaks satellite to Statoil’s Gullfaks field in the North Sea. The job was done using the surface-controlled reservoir analysis and management system (Scrams). This has been developed by the Welldynamics company belonging to Halliburton and Shell. Statoil has previously applied Scrams for remote operation of wells from platforms on its Gullfaks and Sleipner fields. The system makes it possible to monitor and control well operations without expensive interventions, reports Hermod Johansen, reservoir development manager for the Gullfaks satellites. That contributes to improving the recovery factor without adding heavily to costs. Evaluation of the recently completed job will help to determine whether Statoil should continue with remotely-operated well completion. “The advantage of Scrams is that valves on the seabed can be operated from Gullfaks A,” explains Mr Johansen. “In a reservoir containing oil, water and gas, we can shut off a zone producing water and choke back production from zones which primarily produce gas.” I-3 H, which lies in 135 metres of water, was cleaned and brought back on stream, but has now been temporarily shut down because of a turnaround. Statoil has 140 subsea wells, making it the world’s second-largest operator of such installations after Brazil’s Petrobras. By 31 December, the number is due to have risen to about 200.

Statoil has an 8.6 per cent holding in this staged project. The new phase will embrace the eastern and western flanks of the huge Caspian field, which comprises the Azeri, Chirag and Gunashli structures. According to operator BP, the sections being developed in stage II contain about 1.6 billion barrels of oil. Early production from the Chirag platform began in 1997, with daily oil output averaging around 130,000 barrels. In August 2001, the partners sanctioned phase I of a full field development. This covers the central part of the Azeri structure and will yield about a million barrels per day when completed. Production from ACG is due to be piped through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) trunkline from the first quarter of 2005. This will be the third export system for Azeri oil. “Development approval for phase II means we’ve passed an important milestone in the project’s history,” says Ottar Rekdal, senior vice president for international gas and power in International Exploration & Production. “ACG is a massive project, with great significance both for the companies involved and for Azerbaijan.” Apart from Statoil, the ACG partners are BP with 34.1 per cent, Unocal 10 per cent, Lukoil 10 per cent, Socar 10.3 per cent, ExxonMobil eight per cent, TPAO 6.8 per cent, Devon 5.6 per cent, Itochu 3.9 per cent and Hess 2.7 per cent.

She recently met with Hydro employees working in the company\\'s international oil and gas activities. The meeting is part of competence training undertaken by Hydro personnel working with Angola. In line with an agreement signed between Hydro and Amnesty earlier this year, the latter group is helping educate Hydro personnel about human rights in countries where the company operates. The two organizations will share knowledge. Duty to take part The United Nations\\' International Declaration of Human Rights obligates the business community to get involved. The ability to make a tangible difference has grown dramatically in recent years due to significant political changes in the world. In turn, business now has a greater responsibility to act than ever before, Slydal comments. She emphasizes the fact Amnesty does not in principle encourage companies to totally boycott dubious countries. \"We try to instead provide clear information about how conditions really are and how to contend with problems encountered. We provide, for example, advice on what companies should always be prepared for, both internally and concerning communication. An example of this is affirming that human rights are an intregal part of the company\\'s value system, that it is selective regarding suppliers and other coooperation partners, that it will express opposition to torture and police violence, support freedom of speech and the right to assemble, and be willing to take up individual cases with the authorities in individual countries.\" No internal matter \"We still hear the phrase that human rights are \\'an internal matter,\\' but according to international law there\\'s no such thing when basic human rights are violated,\" Slydal insists. During the meeting with Hydro personnel, she focused on conditions in Angola, where the company has been active looking for oil and gas since the 1990s. Several Hydro employees present gave first-hand accounts of how the company strives to act responsibly. Slydal challenges the oil industry to collectively demand that western transparency practices and human rights standards be followed in suspect countries. \"The civil war in Angola, which persisted more than 25 years and only recently ended, contributed to four million Angolans becoming internally displaced refugees. Some 1.5 million of these have acute humanitarian needs. The country has many profoundly traumatized children who fought n the war. The breach of human rights has been atrocious. Freedom of speech has been severely limited, \" Slydal pointed out. \"Our cooperation with Amnesty gives us direct access to knowledge and information useful to Hydro\\'s activities,\" says Camilla Nyhuus Christensen in Hydro CSR, responsible for following up the partnership agreement with Amnesty International Norway.

This represents a further escalation of the strike under way since 29 August, which has already affected the group’s Mongstad refinery near Bergen since midnight on 9 September. The new batch of strikers work in corporate services (KTJ) on procurement, document services, post, payments and invoice handling at Statoil’s offices in Stavanger and Bergen. “We’ll be able to cope with this escalation, although it will mean delays and reduced service in some areas,” says senior vice president Randi Grung Olsen in KTJ. Chief Statoil negotiator Jostein Gaasemyr finds it deplorable that more employees of the group are being drawn into the stoppage. “This is particularly incomprehensible when the main barrier to a solution appears to be pay terms in Esso which we have no opportunity to influence,” he says. Since the Mongstad facility was hit by the labour dispute, shipping traffic to and from its associated port has been sharply reduced. Shuttle tankers delivering crude oil from Norwegian offshore fields will be rerouted if necessary.

Involving members of the Joint Association of Private Employees (Prifo), a YS affiliate, the stoppage could be extended to other Statoil employees if it escalates. Some progress was made during the negotiations, with several key demands from Prifo being conceded, reports Jostein Gaasemyr, chief negotiator for the group. “We’re very disappointed that the new round of talks failed to produce a result,” he comments.

       " 'Ormen Lange on stage in Rio The Ormen Lange gas development took center stage in Rio last week when Hydro senior vice president and Ormen Lange Unit committee chair Bengt Lie Hansen presented the project at \"the Olympics of the oil and gas industry\" - the World Petroleum Congress. Development operator Hydro was able to confirm the project \"is on its way to bringing gas on stream by 2007... that we\\'ve so far solved technical challenges, like laying pipeline on the field\\'s moonscape in the subsea Storegga slide and contending with flow assurance of the wellstream in sub-zero temperatures ... and that we\\'re right on schedule,\" he comments. Lying off the north-western Norwegian coast at water depths of 800-1,100 meters, the Ormen Lange development is estimated to cost between NOK 35-40 billion (USD 4.7-5.4 billion). The field holds some 400 billion cubic meters of gas and is projected to supply between 15-25 billion cubic meters (bcm) gas per year. Pipeline decision \"The UK market seems most promising now,\" says Lie Hansen, explaining that a decision whether to connect the field to existing UK pipelines or build a new transport system will be made by the end of this year. If a new transport system is chosen, a decision between a 42-inch or 48-inch diameter pipeline must be made. \"A 48-inch pipe would be the largest subsea pipeline ever laid. It would travel 1,200 kilometers and weigh 1.4 million tonnes,\" he explains, adding \"that\\'s a lot of steel.\" The larger pipeline would have an annual 25 bcm capacity and the smaller some 20 bcm per year. Ormen Lange\\'s gas volumes and pipeline capacity will help push Norway\\'s total gas sales above 100 bcm per year, making it the second largest gas exporter in the world after Russia. \"Ormen\\'s reservoir has the capacity to supply the larger quantity of gas,\" Lie Hansen affirms.

On or offshore Hydro\\'s recommendation to the partners whether to send the gas to a land-based treatment facility in Aukra municipality or to process the gas offshore is set for Sept. 26.

The project will give Norsk Hydro a competitive edge in new deep-water projects and enhance the company\\'s technological image internationally. Governance process Hydro also implemented a new \"Ormen Lange governance process,\" explains Lie Hansen. \"It\\'s a common decision making process accepted by Ormen Lange partners replacing each partner\\'s own value assurance process and owned by the Ormen Lange Management Committee.

       " 'Investing in climate projects \"We look upon Plantar as a way of testing different climate projects,\" say Lasse Nord and Liv Rathe i Hydro. Yet leading environmental organizations have asked Hydro, Statoil and the Norwegian state to reconsider taking part in the Brazilian climate project that will gain them climate credits. \"The media have stated that Hydro and Statoil have invested USD 5 million each, and the Norwegian state USD 10 million, or a total sum of 150 million Norwegian kroner, in the Brazilian Plantar project. This is a misunderstanding,\" says senior vice president Lasse Nord, who heads Hydro\\'s Climate and Environment function. \"The NOK 150 million represents the total Norwegian investment in the World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) that is currently considering some 30 odd projects,\" he says. Plantar is the only PCF project in a developing country. PCF involves CO2 fixation, an area that currently represents a very minor share of the total number of projects. More than half of the PCF projects will be targeted at renewable energy sources, especially wind power. The Prototype Carbon Fund, established in the wake of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Kyoto will invest in projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries as well as in transitional economy countries, such as those in Eastern Europe. The Fund is involved in establishing a quota market for these projects. Six countries, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, plus 17 companies, have invested in the Fund, which manages a capital sum of USD 180 million. Charcoal replaces coke The controversial Plantar project in Brazil is a three-phase carbon credit-project that the developer, the forestry company Plantar, will partially finance through the sale of climate credits. In the project\\'s first phase, Plantar will plant eucalyptus on land previously used for grazing in the state of Minas Gerais. The second phase involves the cleaner production of charcoal to reduce methane emissions. The third and final phase involves Plantar using charcoal to replace coke in pig iron production. The idea is that CO2 fixation in the plantation, plus cleaner production by means of charcoal instead of coke, will lead to a reduction in emissions and therefore they can be sold as climate credits. Forests can help to reduce greenhouse gases because the trees absorb CO2 in their growth phase. Environmental groups are opposed But several environmental groups in Norway - The Future in Our Hands, Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, World Wildlife Fund Norway and The Association for International Water and Forest Studies (FIVAS), as well as the organization CDMWatch - are opposed to the forestry planting part of the project. They are advising the companies to reject the credits, which they believe do not contain any guarantee that the projects will have a beneficial climate effect in the long-term, and they claim that Plantar will be able to earn millions of dollars through the sale of credits in a project that is without any value in climate terms. In a joint statement, the environmental organizations state that: \"By approving the credits, Norway will be part of a process that will enable companies and countries to fulfill their commitments to reducing carbon emissions through the use of quotas that do not have ecological or climate value. Not only will this undermine the effectiveness of CDM, but also that of the entire Kyoto protocol.\" Opportunity to learn more In its response, Hydro emphasizes the significant learning opportunity the project will provide. \"We believe that the Prototype Carbon Fund represents a constructive contribution to developing credible mechanisms for registering and controlling global climate gas reductions. But it should come as no surprise to anyone that some of the first projects are being assessed differently with regard to their effect on the climate,\" says Nord. Liv Rathe, head of the new energy supply department at Hydro Energy, and member of the PCF board of investors, points out that PCF is the first initiative taken towards establishing a broad and constructive cooperation between industry, local authorities and host countries with a view to creating a reliable system for climate gas reductions. She adds that even though the Plantar project has been approved by PCF, it is not yet clear how the rules for quota trading will look, and whether the conditions for having credits approved have been met in this project. In an early phase it is nevertheless enormously important to gain experience from different types of projects. Tool of development countries Nord and Rathe believe that the environmental organizations are addressing an important problem when they insist that forest plantations should not be accredited because of the problem of calculating the long-term effects, among other problems. \"This is a legitimate point of view, but it has not been accepted in international environmental negotiations. CO2 fixation in forests has been a mechanism to which many countries - including the least developed countries with little industry - attach a lot of importance. It is in this area that they have something to sell,\" explain Nord and Rathe, who do not think that forest projects will make up a large share of the total number of projects: forest project credits are limited to one percent of the countries\\' total climate gas emissions. \"We expect that such projects will represent an insignificant share of the company\\'s future emission quota dealings. On the other hand, we do not regard it as appropriate to draw any final conclusions regarding emission credits in single projects at this early stage.\" \"We look upon Plantar as a way of testing different climate projects,\" say Lasse Nord and Liv Rathe i Hydro.

       " 'Strike will have impact A work stoppage at the Statoil-operated Mongstad refinery near Bergen from midnight on Monday 9 September will have big consequences for the group’s operations. This escalation of strike action by the Confederation of Vocational Unions (YS) involves 45 members of its affiliated Joint Association of Private Employees (Prifo). Working in the offsite facilities and the associated port, they are being called out after the failure of pay talks between the YS and the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF). “We greatly regret that we’re being affected by this dispute after reaching agreement with the YS in our own pay negotiations this year,” says Statoil chief negotiator Jostein Gaasemyr. Strike action by a limited number of YS members at Mongstad will have major consequences for operations. Mr Gaasemyr emphasises that Statoil has an obligation to limit the damage caused by a labour dispute of this kind. Immediately after the strike begins, vessel traffic to and from the Port of Mongstad will virtually cease. Refinery output is also set to be reduced, and eventually come to a halt as the storage tanks fill up. Shuttle tankers delivering crude oil from Norwegian offshore fields will be rerouted if necessary. The Troll B and C oil platforms operated in the North Sea by Norsk Hydro can continue to deliver crude to Mongstad by pipeline until the storage facilities are full. A strike at Mongstad will not create immediate problems for fuel and heating oil deliveries in Norway. A work stoppage at the Statoil-operated Mongstad refinery near Bergen from midnight on Monday 9 September will have big consequences for the group’s operations. This escalation of strike action by the Confederation of Vocational Unions (YS) involves 45 members of its affiliated Joint Association of Private Employees (Prifo). Working in the offsite facilities and the associated port, they are being called out after the failure of pay talks between the YS and the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF). “We greatly regret that we’re being affected by this dispute after reaching agreement with the YS in our own pay negotiations this year,” says Statoil chief negotiator Jostein Gaasemyr. Strike action by a limited number of YS members at Mongstad will have major consequences for operations. Mr Gaasemyr emphasises that Statoil has an obligation to limit the damage caused by a labour dispute of this kind. Immediately after the strike begins, vessel traffic to and from the Port of Mongstad will virtually cease. Refinery output is also set to be reduced, and eventually come to a halt as the storage tanks fill up.

Greater cooperation in the North Sea is the theme of a report put forward today by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Oslo and Britain’s Department of Trade and Industry. This study has been drawn up by Norway’s Konkraft industry collaboration and its UK sister organisation Pilot in a bid to exploit synergies between the two countries. “The UK is a big gas market for us,” says Statoil executive vice president Henrik Carlsen. “It’s important that the authorities lay the basis for the best transport solutions so we can reach it. “Given the opportunities offered by cross-border collaboration, it’s important for us that this work doesn’t come to a stop.” Konkraft and Pilot have also looked at the opportunities to cooperate on developing new fields to get more out of resources across the national boundary in the North Sea. Statoil’s Gudrun discovery in the Sleipner area has been used as a case study for the way UK infrastructure could be one option for a development. “By removing barriers to developing fields across the boundary, the supplies industry can win more work,” says Mr Carlsen. The working party has also looked at opportunities for increased standardisation between the two countries in the offshore sector. Close cooperation has been established between companies working on the two continental shelves over health, safety and the environment to get the best out of national rules and practice. According to the working party, closer collaboration between Norway and the UK could lead to savings in the order of USD 2 billion on operation, removal costs and development spending.

       " 'Troll Pilot fulfills expectations After one year\\'s operation, the Troll Pilot seabed separation system has been given top marks for increasing production capacity on Troll C and improving the environment. On 25 August 2001, scarcely two years after the Hydro-operated oil platform Troll C came on stream, Troll Pilot was put into full operation. The system, which is installed on the seabed at a depth of 340 metres some 3.5 kilometres from the platform, uses the gravitation method to separate produced water from the oil and gas stream emanating from four of the 39 wells currently in operation on Troll C. The water is then reinjected into the reservoir, while the separated oil and gas are piped up onto the platform. Produced water accompanies the oil and gas up from the reservoir. As the fields gradually become more mature, the volume of produced water increases. \"The benefits of reducing the volume of water by means of seabed separation are twofold: increased oil production capacity and lower discharges,\" explains Terje Horn, responsible for seabed equipment on Troll. He describes Troll Pilot as a major success. High regularity \"The operational regularity of Troll Pilot has been almost 100 percent this year while the environmental gain has been quite significant. Samples reveal that the injection water after separation contains only 15 ppm (parts per million) oil. By way of comparison, the State Pollution Control Authority has imposed a discharge limit of 40 ppm, while Hydro\\'s internal target is 30 ppm. This water would normally have been released into the sea having undergone normal treatment on the platform,\" says Horn. He adds that the Troll Pilot results confirm that the nearer to the reservoir separation takes place, the easier it is to separate oil and water. The geological structure of Troll make the field especially suitable for seabed separation. Because of its thin oil layers, the field produces a lot of water early in the production phase. Troll Pilot was developed by ABB Offshore Systems in conjunction with Hydro. Next biggest oil producer Troll is not only Norway\\'s largest gas field, it is also the second largest oil field on the Norwegian shelf in terms of recoverable reserves. The two oil platforms - Troll B and Troll C - came on stream in 1995 and 1999, with Hydro as operator. The seabed separation system Troll Pilot is not the first pioneer project on the Troll field. A historical breakthrough occurred in the mid-1990s, when Hydro proved it was possible to recover the thin layers of oil under the gas by means of advanced horizontal drilling and also, more recently, by drilling multilateral wells.

       " 'Exciting fiber-optic test in Oseberg Øst well Hydro has used a fiber-optic pressure/temperature gauge in an oil reservoir for the first time. The down-hole measuring equipment was installed in remote-controlled well E-11C on the Oseberg Øst field, which started producing oil from the Ness and Etive formations on August 10. The pressure gauges, which have so far functioned trouble-free, mark a new milestone in the development of smart offshore technology. Conventional electric pressure gauge systems have performed unreliably in extreme conditions. Well E-11C has exceptionally tough conditions - the gauges must operate at a depth of 3,773 meters under 289 bar pressure. Where pressure is measured in the reservoir area, the temperature rises to a very high 125 degrees Celsius. Pressure and temperature are measured in two places in the well so data from two zones can be monitored.. In fact, fiber-optics make it possible to measure temperature all the down the cable to the reservoir. Pressure control and water injection \"Extensive knowledge of pressure conditions is imperative to well control,\" says Øyvind Midttveit, who is discipline manager for production technology on the Oseberg Øst field in Hydro Oil & Energy\\'s Operations and Production Norway unit. The well has functioned as a producer since starting operation, but will be converted to a water injector. \"Efficient operations are dependent on having precise knowledge about pressure conditions in the reservoir to optimally control water injection,\" he says. Well E-11C has been drilled and completed with zone-controlled water injection to hold pressure up in the reservoir. The well produces oil from the two formations Ness and Etive . The fiber-optic sensors are supplied by Optoplan/Weatherford. Pioneer project \"Fiber-optic costs more at the onset than other pressure and temperature measuring technology, but is expected to give more reliable information on high temperature. That\\'s why we\\'ve provided research and development support to this project. After accruing some experience with the first well, we might well install the same technology in other wells. Increased fiber-optic use is part of Hydro\\'s strategy for better well instrumentation.

Hydro started looking at Angola in the early 1990s and saw opportunities to bring forward our experience from deep waters on the Norwegian continental shelf.\" Torn asunder \"Setting up business in a country torn apart by civil war raises in itself a number of sustainability issues.

That includes not being party to corruption, and that we apply our environmental principles regardless of where we operate. \"After careful consideration, it was decided to invest in Angola, and we are confident that we have a role to play in helping build a sustainable oil industry in that country and, in the process, make a more general contribution - although on a modest scale - to a better future for the communities in which we are involved,\" Reiten asserts. Angola is rich in natural resources, not least in oil and gas. However, measured by economic and social indicators, Angola remains an extremely poor country. Sharing expertise \"We brought forward a commitment to our operations in Angola to train and develop a workforce consisting mainly of Angolans, who will one day be able to run our operations there without expatriate assistance.

They can produce 200,000 liters of water per day, which is enough for 6,000 people and 350 farms. \"Norsk Hydro has built a reputation in Angola for being more than just an oil company,\" Reiten affirms. \"Our participation in aid projects shows we are an international company with expertise in such areas as agriculture and energy production, that are of vital importance to the country\\'s development.

The debate was prefaced by the film \"Eyes for the future,\" produced by Hydro and Schlumberger Oil Services and featuring Hydro\\'s 3D-visualization work in the CAVE. Part of a panel of top international oil industry leaders, Reiten expressed an optimistic attitude towards upping the emphasis on renewable energy. \"Increased use of renewable energy is attainable, but it\\'s important to simultaneously take care of short-term energy needs. An important supposition is to have a more consequential energy policy among the world\\'s countries,\" Reiten said. He ardently expressed the need for energy companies to improve co-operative relationships with government authorities. A unanimous panel said it is vitally important to recruit young, enthusiastic people, and cultivate an international culture in companies to piece together the puzzle of future energy demand. To recruit the best, energy companies must demonstrate they are progressive and environmentally engaged, they claimed. Reiten was asked how he intends to recruit young people to Hydro. \"There\\'s quite a lot I\\'m tempted to say to my 17 year old son, but if I was to recruit him, I\\'d say we need your enthusiasm and your impatience. Future generations need energy and we don\\'t have all the answers.\" Happy with Hydro stand Reiten was at Hydro\\'s exhibition stand Tuesday morning when King Harald paid a visit.

It aims to provide a better overall understanding of the way Statoil is managed and the relationship between its ethical stances and actual behaviour. The report is divided into chapters which look at the challenges posed under different headings. Each of these sections ends with one or more defined objectives. “For us, sustainable development is about the impact of our operations on people, the environment and society,” observes chief executive Olav Fjell. “We’re talking about results on three bottom lines – financial, environmental and social.” He notes that Statoil seeks to manage its business along these three dimensions in an integrated way, so that the net sum of its operations will be positive both for it and for the world at large. “Through this report, we want to make it clear that we create value both for our owners and for the community.” The Future is Now also covers the group’s history, provides a financial overview and details the criteria applied in managing the group and measuring its performance. Relations with Statoil’s own employees, ethics and issues concerning human rights are all discussed in the report, along with health, safety and the environment. Statoil’s own workforce represents an important target audience for the report. “We want it to stimulate greater awareness and more holistic thinking in our own ranks about the way we do business,” says Mr Fjell. “That’ll also improve risk management.” In addition to all employees, the report will be sent to specially interested investors, government authorities, voluntary organisations and other companies. The report has been presented by Mr Fjell at a press conference in Stavanger today, 26 August, the day before the Offshore Northern Seas exhibition opens.

And we believe we can improve the recovery factor even more.” He noted that the additional oil recovered from these two fields represents NOK 240 billion in extra revenues for the Norwegian community at an oil price of USD 20 per barrel. “Most of this money has ended up in the government’s coffers, but it has not appeared by magic,\" said Mr Fjell. \"It derives from expertise, painstaking work and the willingness to adopt new technological solutions.

Both its former chief executives, Arve Johnsen and Harald Norvik, will be present, along with other present and former senior executives. The other guests include a number of former petroleum and energy ministers as well as most of the Norwegian oil company’s past and present directors. “This event is intended to thank those who have created the company, reflect on the past and look forward to new goals,” says chief executive Olav Fjell. He notes that the development of Statoil represented a national undertaking driven by social commitment, political will and not least industrial visions. The result has been an efficient, profitable and highly competent group, with very well-informed and inventive specialists and managers. At a press briefing in Stavanger today, Statoil reported that the group has accumulated a net profit of NOK 80 billion in current money over its 30-year career. It has paid NOK 170 billion in tax and NOK 26 billion in dividend. “Our results haven’t been uniformly satisfactory,” Mr Fjell admitted. “We’ve had some weak years, and we’ve had some very good ones.” He emphasised that the group’s financial position has steadily strengthened. “We’re in a robust and strong position today.” The press briefing was also told that Statoil has been responsible as operator for procuring goods and services worth just over NOK 500 billion. More than NOK 400 billion of this sum has ended up with Norwegian companies. “One of our most important jobs in the early years was to help develop a competent national industry,” Mr Fjell observed. “Norway has built up a competitive oil-related expertise which is increasingly making international strides.” The 30th anniversary of Statoil’s foundation is being celebrated today, 26 August, with a dinner in Stavanger for 110 people who have made significant contributions to its development.

       " 'Safety must become part of our culture We all know that rules and behavior do not always go hand in hand. Anyone who drives a car has only to think of they way they relate to parking zones, speed limits and U-turns when they are in a hurry and its important to get there in time... ”Our internal efforts in Hydro, together with shared learning with other companies offshore and a good collaboration with the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate have given us good safety regulations in Hydro,” says Gunnar Breivik, who is in charge of health, safety and environment on the Norwegian shelf. ”These regulations must be constantly quality assured, and we carry out drills. But very many of the incidents on Hydro’s installations take place despite the regulations, despite the fact that we know better. To improve, we have to work on our attitudes and values, with our culture.” The new Hydro index offers opportunities And this is where it gets exciting. Hydro is a pioneer in this area on the Norwegian shelf. The development and use of the Hydro index offers new perspectives in the focused work on safety carried out in the company. Three years of research in Hydro on the connection between values, attitudes and behavior have given new insights. Thousands of employees have answered the questions in the large-scale research project on diversity in Hydro. This looks at attitudes, at connections. The answers are compared with actual behavior in the organization. Sick leave, incidents, production, results, delays... The task was to identify recurring attitudes in individuals and groups with certain types of behavior. If a connection could be found, it would be possible to measure the risk of negative behavior – before attitudes become action. And it would be possible to direct the work on changing attitudes more accurately and to assess whether measures are effective over time. International attention The project manager for the development of the Hydro index, research scientist Yngve Lindvig at the Institute of Educational Research at the University of Oslo, found clear connections. “Many people were surprised at connections that had not been identified before. Our findings have, in fact, attracted international attention,” he says. ”This is because we have succeeded in singling out and putting together attitudes that statistically give an outstanding opportunity to predict the behavior of the individual or the organization. We started by asking people several hundred questions, and have now managed to reduce the number to 40. This has given us a tool that we can use actively and throughout the whole organization without generating major costs. The Hydro index will now replace the traditional psychosocial surveys that the organization used previously. Everyone in the offshore operations organization has been asked to reply to the 40 questions. ”Hydro’s work on safety culture represents a positive follow-up of the new regulations on health, safety and environment,” says Angela Ebbesen in the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. For several years she has been in charge of the Directorate’s monitoring activities and is currently working on HSE and public affairs. “At the safety seminar that Hydro arranged last autumn, it was positive to note that management is taking on a particular responsibility for the development of a good HSE culture. Efforts seem to correspond well the expectations expressed in Report no. 7 to the Storting on safety offshore,” she says. “Safety culture is primarily a management responsibility; culture develops from whatever management gives focus and priority. Culture is part of the furniture in an organization and gives people a gut feeling about ”what we do here”. As I see it, Hydro’s model focuses on both individual values and behavior, and on the organization’s culture and structure. The challenge is to work on both at the same time. Experience is what counts.” We all know that rules and behavior do not always go hand in hand. Anyone who drives a car has only to think of they way they relate to parking zones, speed limits and U-turns when they are in a hurry and its important to get there in time... ”Our internal efforts in Hydro, together with shared learning with other companies offshore and a good collaboration with the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate have given us good safety regulations in Hydro,” says Gunnar Breivik, who is in charge of health, safety and environment on the Norwegian shelf. ”These regulations must be constantly quality assured, and we carry out drills. But very many of the incidents on Hydro’s installations take place despite the regulations, despite the fact that we know better. To improve, we have to work on our attitudes and values, with our culture.” The new Hydro index offers opportunities And this is where it gets exciting. Hydro is a pioneer in this area on the Norwegian shelf. The development and use of the Hydro index offers new perspectives in the focused work on safety carried out in the company. Three years of research in Hydro on the connection between values, attitudes and behavior have given new insights. Thousands of employees have answered the questions in the large-scale research project on diversity in Hydro. This looks at attitudes, at connections. The answers are compared with actual behavior in the organization. Sick leave, incidents, production, results, delays... The task was to identify recurring attitudes in individuals and groups with certain types of behavior. If a connection could be found, it would be possible to measure the risk of negative behavior – before attitudes become action. And it would be possible to direct the work on changing attitudes more accurately and to assess whether measures are effective over time. International attention The project manager for the development of the Hydro index, research scientist Yngve Lindvig at the Institute of Educational Research at the University of Oslo, found clear connections. “Many people were surprised at connections that had not been identified before. Our findings have, in fact, attracted international attention,” he says. ”This is because we have succeeded in singling out and putting together attitudes that statistically give an outstanding opportunity to predict the behavior of the individual or the organization. We started by asking people several hundred questions, and have now managed to reduce the number to 40. This has given us a tool that we can use actively and throughout the whole organization without generating major costs. The Hydro index will now replace the traditional psychosocial surveys that the organization used previously. Everyone in the offshore operations organization has been asked to reply to the 40 questions. ”Hydro’s work on safety culture represents a positive follow-up of the new regulations on health, safety and environment,” says Angela Ebbesen in the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. For several years she has been in charge of the Directorate’s monitoring activities and is currently working on HSE and public affairs. “At the safety seminar that Hydro arranged last autumn, it was positive to note that management is taking on a particular responsibility for the development of a good HSE culture. Efforts seem to correspond well the expectations expressed in Report no. 7 to the Storting on safety offshore,” she says. “Safety culture is primarily a management responsibility; culture develops from whatever management gives focus and priority. Culture is part of the furniture in an organization and gives people a gut feeling about ”what we do here”. As I see it, Hydro’s model focuses on both individual values and behavior, and on the organization’s culture and structure. The challenge is to work on both at the same time. Experience is what counts.”',\n",
       " 'Safe value creation offshore We shall be the safest value creator on the Norwegian shelf, and achieving this goal depends on every single one of us, says president of business sector Torgeir Kydland, Operations and Production Norway, in his address to Hydro employees at general meetings offshore. Being good isnt enough. We have to be excellent. ”Working with safety requires both patience and impatience,” underlines Kydland. He refers to the fact that Hydro has carried out a number of safety projects, has looked at safety throughout the organization, analyzed routines and procedures and compared them to current practice and has identified the challenges to be met. ”We have systematically closed the gaps between procedures and actual work processes. And we have learnt a great deal about better ways of working – by looking at everything with fresh eyes, involving employees and working together, and by encouraging full openness about any situation that could lead to an accident. Hydro’s operational organization in Bergen has just launched its new set of values and vision. Safety-related attitudes and behavior are reflected throughout this work. “If we are to deliver good results, it is essential that we have a real, shared understanding of where we stand, and of our values and challenges,” says Kydland. “We must all contribute what we can towards higher performance. Focusing on one’s own opportunities rather than on others’ weaknesses creates energy, and this is why I constantly refer to the motto ”It depends on me.” ”Attitudes and behavior are what distinguish the best from the second best.

       " 'Positive feedback from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate Hydro has laid the groundwork for an extensive change process in the health, safety and environment area, as the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate confirmed in an inspection report in March. The inspection was carried out at Njord in October and November last year and looked at various HSE management elements that are important culture bearers in the company. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which has followed closely Hydro’s improvement processes and the results achieved, writes in its report that the Njord organization seems to provide an open, secure and positive working environment. The NPD also finds that discipline groups and individual employees have integrity and take a critical but constructive approach to operations and have established channels for taking up relevant issues. ”This is a tribute to the whole organization. We must take this feedback as a source of inspiration to continue the good work on improving safety,” says Hydro’s head of HSE on the Norwegian continental shelf, Gunnar Breivik. He sees the NPD report as a positive response to an organization that has worked untiringly on improving safety. And for Njord, this is a real feather in the cap. “We mustn’t become over-confident. We still have to work hard to maintain a good level of safety throughout the operation. We shall take this positive feedback as a sign that we are moving in the right direction.

       " 'New and improved behaviour can be taught All Hydro employees working in the Norwegian offshore sector and a number of onshore personnel - totalling 1,600 - are being required to take a special behavioural training course. The company has already invested NOK 10 million into the project this year. The behavioural training program focuses on influencing attitudes within Hydro’s safety culture. Culture builiding through proficiency training is one of the key components of a plan initiated last fall to achieve better safety. The behavioural training is directed at groups who work together on a daily basis, so it is easier for them to continue training after the course is through. The two-day long course is exclusively developed by and for Hydro in cooperation with Nutec and the Administrative Research Fund at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration in Bergen, Norway. Before the course starts, everyone gets homework that asks them to define their values and visions. This is intended to generate self-awareness, and help participants see how to do things differently and bring about desired behaviour in an everyday context. The course includes group discussions and work to determine solutions for relevant situations. Towards the end of the course, the groups summarize their progress, set goals for the future and discuss how to achieve targets. During the training, individual participants are asked to reflect on their own situation and/or behaviour and recommend areas for concrete improvement. The program also entails having individuals enter into a contract with their leader on how they can improve and train to attain optimal results. \"More difficult than it sounds\" ”This is more difficult than it sounds,” Helge Schjøtt, whose daily job entails completion work on the drilling rig “West Vanguard.” He took the behavioural training course in Bergen at the start of April with 24 others from rig projects on the Troll field, including drilling operations managers. ”One thing is to sharpen up and abide by the platform’s rules and regulations. But what if one of the bosses takes a short cut? Or one of the most experienced on the shift? Dare we say something? What if we think the rules are dumb? That they’re not practical? What does it mean that safety comes before everything else? Or, if we get the blame for a near-miss, are we secure enough to report ourselves? “It’s when it begins to cost you something directly that it gets difficult. Then we must have a culture that extends security and openness in the group and in the organization,” Schjøtt comments. ”The behaviour training stimulated good discussion.

       " 'Joint safety challenges in Statoil and Hydro January 14, 2002 was the kick-off of a joint Statoil and Hydro campaign to increase safety in the supply chain. Collaboration on their own and each others safety is regarded as both appropriate and important. The supply chain is defined as the coordination between support units on land, suppliers, bases, vessels and offshore installations. Hydro and Statoil have a total of 55 installations. Each year 700,000 tonnes of supplies and 1,300,000 of bulk goods are taken on board offshore installations. ”The campaign focuses on existing requirements for supply. We must comply with our procedures and best practice and be aware of the consequences of the failure of a link in the chain. We also focus on the importance of the right competence at all links, and in promoting the right behavior,” underlines Sjur W. Knudsen, who is in charge of Logistics and Marine Operations in Hydro. “We hope that this campaign will increase awareness of the next link in the chain – both ahead and behind each individual. Each link depends on everyone following procedures and routines,” he points out. ”We shall reverse the trend of a growing number of incidents and near accidents in connection with supply to drilling and production installations. We hope that we will get feedback on all the improvement measures that have been identified so far, so that we can maintain focus on improving safety in the supply chain,” he says. Meanwhile, a number of improvement measures are being worked on in the Logistics and Marine Operations unit. The campaign has been developed in collaboration Statoil and will be implemented in both companies. “We have had the same challenges as Hydro with regard to competence and attitudes, and working on this together is very valuable. There is no reason to compete in this area, rather the opposite,” says Thormod Hope, senior vice president Emergency Preparedness, Marine Operations and Air Transport in Statoil. “The new procedure has given us a boost in our safety work and logistics,” he agrees.

       " 'High level of accuracy under record-heavy lift The lifting of the 950 tonne Fram Vest process module is the heaviest lift to a loosely anchored, semi-submersible floating production platform on the North Sea that has been carried out. This complicated operation required meticulous planning, including specific module tests. Fram Vest will come onstream in October next year. Two subsea frames at 360 meters depth will each have four wells that are linked to the Troll C platform 20 kilometers away. The daily production of 60,000 barrels of oil from Fram Vest will be processed in a separate module on Troll C. The process module was lifted on board Troll C in May this year by means of the lifting vessel \"Saipem 7000\" which lay in dynamic positioning, while Troll C was loosely anchored. The module was placed with the highest level of accuracy on three supports over the winch house on the aft port column of the platform. “We have been highly focused on ensuring that the lift would be carried out in a safe and controlled manner,” says Halfdan Knudsen, client’s representative for Fram Vest. Not much model testing of North Sea lifting operations has been carried out in recent years. But as this lift was so unusual, and as both the lifting vessel and Troll C would be afloat, model tests had to be run. Ståle Øvretveit, who is Hydro’s project manager for model testing at Marintek’s sea basin at Trondheim, explains that over 100 lifting and positioning attempts were made using different wave directions and heights. Marintek also carried out computer simulations of module and vessel movements to document the forces at play during the lift.

       " 'Invited to bid off Venezuela The Venezuelan government announced on Friday 23 August that Statoil has been invited to bid by the end of the year on blocks 3 and 4 in the Plataforma Deltana area off the eastern part of the country. A successful bid will mean acquiring the operatorship of one block. This will involve exploration, subsequent field development, transport, liquefaction and marketing of gas/condensates. The blocks will be awarded in December of this year. A successful bid will lead to an important partnership with Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Statoil has signed a memorandum of understanding with El Paso of the USA and Norsk Hydro of Norway, under which these companies may form a consortium for Plataforma Deltana activity. “This is a very promising area with the potential for major finds of gas and condensate,” says Statoil executive vice president Richard Hubbard. “We aim to place a winning bid, and look forward to expanding our business in Venezuela and to increasing our cooperation with PDVSA. Our extensive experience in exploration, in the development of large complex projects, and in production, transport and marketing of both oil and gas will contribute to a world-class project in Plataforma Deltana and to significant value creation for PDVSA and Venezuela.” The two blocks, out of a total of five delineated so far, cover a total area of approximately 2 000 square kilometres, with a water depth ranging from around 80 to 700 metres. Development will require an offshore production facility and a pipeline to the Paria peninsula in Sucre state, where plans call for a gas liquefaction plant to be built. With its vast reserves of oil and gas, Venezuela is a natural focal point for Statoil’s business activities. The group has a 15 per cent share in the large Sincor heavy oil project, which successfully started production last year, and 27 per cent of the LL652 oil field in Lake Maracaibo. The new venture in the Plataforma Deltana area could lead to the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) close to the North American market, and to business growth in line with Statoil’s strategy. Statoil has LNG technology, project and marketing experience. Development has begun on the Snøhvit field in the Barents Sea off northern Norway, which will deliver LNG to the USA in 2006.

Due to be installed on the Norwegian Sea field, this 14,000-tonne structure comprises four support columns and a ring pontoon. It will be freighted from Samsung’s Korean yard to Aker Stord south of Bergen by 30 July 2004 for mating with the topsides. Plans call for Kristin to start production on 1 October 2005. “Contracts worth over NOK 8 billion from a total estimated development bill of NOK 17 billion have been placed so far,” reports Nina Udnes Tronstad, operations vice president for Halten Bank South. Orders for the riser balcony and flare tower are due to be awarded in the autumn, along with the contract for marine operations. Kristin will have the capacity to produce 126,000 barrels of condensate and just over 18 million cubic metres of rich gas per day. This output is due to flow via 12 subsea wells from a reservoir at a depth of almost 5,000 metres. At 900 bar and 170°C respectively, pressure and temperature in the field are higher than in any previous development on the Norwegian continental shelf.

The Solsikke license was awarded to Hydro in concession round 16 in 2000. The prospect is considered one of the most interesting in the Norwegian oil sector and may hold enormous volumes of natural gas. The Solsikke license consists of four blocks. One of them will be drilled by the drilling rig \"Scarabeo 5\" at the start of October.

Work to lay the gas pipeline from Grane to the Heimdal gas center is now underway. The pipeline installation ship \"Castoro Sei\" welded a total of 16,650 sections of pipe measuring 12 meters long to complete the Grane to Sture transport system. Hydro\\'s contractor for the work offshore was European Marine Contractors. The Grane to Sture system - designed by Norwegian engineering company Reinertsen - crosses several other pipelines and cables and is laid into a furrow of stone and gravel just meters away from the Oseberg to Sture pipeline. The greatest sea depth the pipeline traverses is 355 meters - through the Norwegian Trench. More than 110,000 tonnes of rock and gravel was dumped onto the most difficult seabed areas to establish a foundation for the pipeline, says project controller Terje Thorsen, Hydro Technology and Projects. \"The work was very demanding, but it went exceptionally well.\" Thorsen is especially satisfied to have avoided using divers to join the pipe sections. It was also possible to move the drilling rig \"Scarabeo 6\" to and from the field without interrupting the pipe-laying operation. It saved NOK 20 million and even more important, the risks associated with diving operations was avoided.

       " 'North wind power A wind power park on the remote far northern Norwegian island of Havøygavlen - built jointly by Hydro and energy development companies Nuon and Norsk Miljøkraft - will start generating electricity in October. Some 40 workers have been busy all summer installing 16 giant wind turbines on the island of Havøygavlen, 180 kilometers north-east of Hammerfest in Måsøy municipality in the North Norway county of Finnmark, to start operations in October. The wind turbines, delivered by Danish/German company Nordex, are the largest currently available on the market with a capacity of 2.5 megawatts each. The park\\'s total production of 40 megawatts is comparable to about 10 percent of a modern gas power plant. The Havøygavlen wind park is capable of supplying 5,000 to 6,000 households with electricity. The facility represents a doubling of the wind power capacity currently produced in Norway, says Morten Røsæg, project development manager in Hydro Energy and board chairman of company Arctic Wind. Public assistance The idea to build a wind power park in Finnmark came from Norsk Miljøkraft AS, which did the initial leg-work. The Tromsø, Norway based energy development company later joined forces with Dutch energy concern Nuon to realize the project. Nuon has an ownership share of 53.3 percent in the jointly held Arctic Wind, while Hydro has 41.5 percent and Norsk Miljøkraft five percent. Of the NOK 336 million (USD 44 million) that the wind park has cost to build, some NOK 65 million has been contributed by the Norwegian government. \"Without some form of public support, the wind power project would not be economically feasible for the developers,\" says Røsæg. \"In addition, the sale of green power certificates has carried substantial weight for the project\\'s economic viability.\" The green power certificate system originated in the Netherlands and has inspired start-ups in several European countries. The certificates guarantee that the power sold is produced by an environmentally friendly means. It can also give buyers a certified reduction in the electricity tax levied in many European countries. Calm breeze or howling gale The Havøygavlen site satisfies the demands for a wind power park. With an average wind speed of more than 9 meters per second, it is actually one of the best places for wind power in all Europe, says Øysten Jacobsen, Hydro\\'s project manager for the Havøygavlen endeavor. The island has good stable wind conditions and access to established infrastructure. It is hooked up to the power transmission network in Norway and has a developed harbor into which equipment can be shipped. The equipment consists of 120 meter-high wind turbines with rotor blades that cover a 5,000 square meter area, about the same size as a standard football field. The turbines produce energy with a wind power of up to 25 meters per second, comparable to a howling gale. They can withstand severe winds, but production is shut down for safety reasons when winds reach hurricane force, says Jacobsen. Environmental respect The regulations require that there is a distance of at least 500 meters from the turbines to nearby buildings. On Havøygavlen, the distance to the closest turbine is at least one kilometer, Jacobsen says. He describes the facility as environmentally friendly and emphasizes that respect for the environment has been paramount in executing the project. Despite many critical voices, both the Diretorate for Nature Management and the Central Office of Historic Monuments have singled out the project as a prime positive example. What now? Hydro Energy is discussing other wind power projects both in and out of Norway. \"Hydro is evaluating renewable energy as an interesting growth market. Havøygavlen is the first step concerning wind power in Norway,\" says Røsæg. \"New projects under development must also prove themselves satifactorily profitable before realized. This will demand public support similar to that we have today. \"Wind power is one of several interesting energy forms, but it can\\'t cover the increasing demand for energy alone.\" Nuon backs renewable energy In 2010, some 10 percent of the electricity delivered by Nuon will come from renewable energy sources.

In addition to the coast of mid-Norway, sites under investigation are near Kalundborg in Denmark, Berlin in Germany and south Wales in the UK. The first part of this saline aquifer carbon dioxide storage ( Sacs ) programme recently ended. It monitored deposition of the greenhouse gas on Statoil’s Sleipner fields in the North Sea. Phase two, which starts this autumn, aims to apply experience from the Sleipner area to other European locations where injection below ground might be possible. It could be relevant, for instance, to drill a deviated well from Statoil’s refinery site at Kalundborg to a formation a little further north. This could then be used to deposit carbon dioxide both from the refinery and from other industrial plants in the area.

       " 'Marathon with deepwater gas find off Nova Scotia US oil company Marathon Oil Company today announced a gas discovery at the Annapolis G-24 deepwater wildcat well offshore Nova Scotia. The Annapolis G-24 well is located on Exploration License 2377, 215 miles south of Halifax in 5,500 feet of water. The well encountered approximately 100 feet of net gas pay over several zones. The well will be temporarily abandoned, allowing for re-entry at a later date. Commenting on the discovery, Marathon senior vice president of Worldwide Exploration, Phil Behrman, said, \"This discovery of gas is an important first step in the developing deepwater play offshore Nova Scotia. While the results of the Annapolis well are promising, further activities will be required to determine the commerciality of the discovery. Plans are being developed for additional seismic and drilling in 2003.\" The B-24 well, the first on the Annapolis Prospect, was suspended on March 24 after experiencing a well control incident caused by an influx of gas at a well depth of 11,469 feet. Following a detailed analysis of this event and the condition of the well, Marathon and its partners in the well elected to plug and abandon the B-24 well for mechanical reasons. A replacement well, the Annapolis G-24, was spud on April 18, adjacent to the B-24 well, and drilled to a final total depth of 20,282 feet. Marathon holds a 30-percent interest in the Annapolis prospect and serves as operator. The remaining interests are held by EnCana Corporation (26 percent), Norsk Hydro Canada Oil and Gas Inc.

       " 'Expanding Vestprosess Work has started on upgrading the Vestprosess facilities at Statoil’s Mongstad refinery near Bergen, with preliminary engineering under way at Kværner Engineering & Construction (E&C). Capacity in the plant is to be almost doubled in order to accept natural gas liquids from the Kvitebjørn and Visund fields in the North Sea from 2004 and 2005 respectively. The total cost of the expansion is put at just over NOK 500 million. “This will reinforce our already strong position in the European market for liquefied petroleum gases,” says Thor Inge Willumsen, senior vice president for oil trading and supply. “ Vestprosess will gain increased significance as a major export facility for propane and butane.” In addition to preliminary engineering, the contract with Kværner E&C contains an option for work relating to the actual upgrading. This is due to start early next year. Kværner E&C’s office in the Netherlands will be in charge of the assignment. Vestprosess vice president John Stangenes notes that the facilities have achieved very high operating regularity since they came on stream in 1999 to produce propane, butane and naphtha. The core of the plant is a distillation unit for NGLs which can process about 175 tonnes of feedstock per hour. After the upgrading, it will be able to handle roughly 335 tonnes per hour.

Placed by Statoil on behalf of the licensees in the Norwegian Sea gas and condensate field, the job runs initially for two years until the autumn of 2004. It can be extended to 2006. This contract represents the exercise of options in Statoil’s framework agreement with Halliburton. In addition to drilling and completion fluids and cementing, it covers pumping and personnel services. “ Kristin is a reservoir under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP), and presents technological challenges,” explains Bengt Rasmussen, drilling manager for the field. “To carry out operations safely and efficiently, we need to adopt the best available technology, products and personnel.” Halliburton has experience with HTHP reservoirs on the UK continental shelf, and can offer a drilling fluid system developed specially for such operations. Drilling work is due to run from the summer of 2003 to the summer of 2006. Plans call for Kristin to be produced via 12 subsea wells tied back to a floating platform, which will come on stream in the autumn of 2005. The field is due to deliver about 35 billion cubic metres of gas to 2016. Estimated output of condensate (light oil) and natural gas liquids over the same period will be 220 million barrels and 8.5 million tonnes respectively. A contract worth about NOK 260 million, including options, covering drilling and well fluids and cementing services for the Kristin development has been awarded to Halliburton. Placed by Statoil on behalf of the licensees in the Norwegian Sea gas and condensate field, the job runs initially for two years until the autumn of 2004. It can be extended to 2006. This contract represents the exercise of options in Statoil’s framework agreement with Halliburton. In addition to drilling and completion fluids and cementing, it covers pumping and personnel services. “ Kristin is a reservoir under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP), and presents technological challenges,” explains Bengt Rasmussen, drilling manager for the field. “To carry out operations safely and efficiently, we need to adopt the best available technology, products and personnel.” Halliburton has experience with HTHP reservoirs on the UK continental shelf, and can offer a drilling fluid system developed specially for such operations. Drilling work is due to run from the summer of 2003 to the summer of 2006.

The penalty is based on an alleged failure by Statoil to check that drill floor personnel on the night of the accident were adequately qualified. In addition, the public prosecutor has also found that the pipehandling system on the platform breached regulations and was not in acceptable condition. Roughneck Børre Dalstein was crushed during the work of freeing drillpipe in the platform derrick. The 27-year-old was flown to Trondheim Regional Hospital, but his life could not be saved. Investigations were immediately launched by Statoil, the police and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. These concluded that the accident was caused by personnel working within the operational range of remotely-controlled pipehandling equipment while the latter was in use. Statoil chief executive Olav Fjell says that the group takes the fine very seriously, and will quickly assess the basis on which it has been imposed. “We launched our own investigation of the accident in 1999, and immediately adopted measures to improve the weaknesses identified in our report, and which now form the basis for the fine. “We are very concerned to enhance the safety of our operations.

       " 'Waste treatment contract Statoil has awarded the Spesialavfall Rogaland company a frame contract for handling waste for its facilities on land and offshore Norway. The contract will run for three years, with an option to extend by two years. Its value is roughly NOK 200 million, excluding the extension option. Spesialavfall Rogaland will be responsible for handling all waste and treating processing materials from drilling and well operations. The deal covers all Statoil-operated fields, supply bases and the land-based plants at Tjeldbergodden, Kollsnes and Kårstø. \"The aim of the contract is to achieve the highest possible level of waste recovery and sorting, in addition to ensuring that waste treatment inflicts a minimum of harm and inconvenience on people and the environment,\" reports Magne Skorpen, special adviser for contracts in procurement and logistics. Special arrangements have been made to ensure that Statoil achieves higher levels of waste recovery and reuse. The biggest improvement, compared with the current agreement, will involve the processing materials from drilling and well operations, where greater reuse at lower cost should be achieved by means of better management and special arrangements. Total savings with the new contract are estimated at roughly NOK 24 million per year based on the same volumes of waste as in 2001. The contract takes effect on 1 October 2002.

       " 'Hydro plans gas export from Visund The Hydro-operated Visund field in the Tampen area of the North Sea shall, according to plan, export gas reserves via the Kollsnes plants in Øygarden outside of Bergen from 2005, subject to approval from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. The project, which is linked to the drilling and production platform Visund, was approved on Tuesday by the owners of the Visund field. The formal plan for development and operation was therefore sent to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy for final approval on Tuesday afternoon. \"Norsk Hydro and the other partners in Visund intend to recover the considerable volumes of gas that are available in the Visund field. We want to alter the Visund platform and lay a pipeline so that gas export can start from the platform in 2005. We aim to export the total reserve of gas of around 55 billion cubic meters,\" says senior vice president in Hydro Arild Unneberg Earlier than planned In addition to export, the project also covers increased gas processing capacity on the platform that will accelerate oil production. This solution will make it possible to export large volumes of gas from the field two years earlier than originally planned. \"Visund currently produces oil, but there are also considerable gas volumes in the reservoir which we intend to realize this valuethrough export,\" says Unneberg. Three alternative routes have been considered: export to the Heimdal platforms for subsequent export to Europe; export to the Brent B platform for subsequent export to the UK; and export to Kollsnes in Øygarden, via the Kvitebjørn pipeline. The partnership found the last alternative was most attractive for Visund. The investments for the development, including modifications on the infrastructure are estimated at approximately NOK 2.1 billion up to the point when gas exports can start in 2005.

       " 'Powering Troll with new technology Big environmental gains are promised from the use of innovative technology to supply electricity generated on land to compressors being installed on Troll A in the North Sea. This solution eliminates emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the Statoil platform and its associated gas treatment plant at Kollsnes near Bergen. Turbines would otherwise have been needed offshore to drive the compressors, releasing some 230,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and 230 tonnes of nitrogen oxides annually. High voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technology means that electricity can be supplied to Troll A from Kollsnes , where a transformer and DC rectifier are to be installed. Sent to the platform along specially developed DC cables, this power will pass to an alternating current rectifier and special motors. The solution has been used before, explains compression project manager Atle Grung Eide. But this represents its first application to an electrical drive system for compressors. ABB has developed the system in cooperation with Statoil, he adds. “The underlying technology development is a good example of the way industrial collaboration yields results.” A contract to supply and install the submarine power cables and to build the electrical compressor drives has been awarded to ABB by the Troll licensees. Worth roughly NOK 600 million in all, this delivery also covers construction of the transformer and rectifier station at Kollsnes. The new compressors, costed at some NOK 3 billion, are required to offset declining reservoir pressure in Troll as gas production proceeds and to help drive output through the pipelines to land.

This year\\'s winning paper - \"The Case for SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) Legislation at Community Level\" - critically examines the case for European Union legislation in the field of SRI. \"Firstly, we propose to examine the need for such action in the context of changing investor profiles and attitudes, from the viewpoint of the screening companies and also in light of legislative developments at a national level,\" said Gavin, an Irishman studying for his Master\\'s Degree in Advanced European Legal Studies. The students claim \"social pressure and growing interest for sustainable investments have triggered the importance and necessity for sustainable actions and sound policies\" and argue that \"there can be no denying recent international and domestic trends which point to a growing consumer demand for ethical investment products.\" They point out that \"screened (ethical) portfolios\" in the US were worth USD 1,497 billion in 1999 versus just USD 529 billion in 1997. The UK ethical investment market grew by 48 percent between 1997 and 1998. The figures are based on a submission to the Australian Parliament by the Australian Conservation Foundation. Less risk, more gain \"Consumers are not only investing in ethical investment products because of a perceived benefit for the environment or society as a whole. They are now viewing ethical investment as carrying less risk than so-called \\'unscreened\\' investments whilst providing the potential for higher returns,\" commented Smildzina, who is working on her Master\\'s degree in European Studies with an environmental focus. They assert that a \"stumbling block\" is insufficient information, reporting and, subsequently, transparency of companies participating on SRI indices. \"If consumers are demanding ethical investment products, it is essential that they be provided with sufficient and accurate information to enable them to differentiate between an ethical and unscreened investment product at the point of sale.\" Sensible legislation One area of legislation that \"would make sense\" would include the reporting methods of the screened companies - \"since they usually represent one of the major sources of information for the evaluation. The level of discourse and the reliability of the information they provide is crucial,\" remarked Hufschmid. Legislation should not stifle SRI through high costs of compliance and there is a danger of trying to make \"one size fit all.\" The report concluded that legislation itself is not enough to achieve the EU\\'s CSR goals. \"If real progress is to be made in delivering concrete improvements, it requires joint actions - partnership of government, NGOs, business, and trade unions.\" Why pursue SRI At the end of their presentation, the students posed two questions to Hydro: Why does it invest so much time and money into CSR issues, and why does it try to be included in social investment indices? \"One of the things is altruism,\" said Hydro vice president of oil and gas strategy David Nunn. \"One of the main drivers is that we\\'re looking at increasing Hydro\\'s stock on the market... more investors are becoming aware of the value of CSR.\" Hydro has a progressive CSR legacy and continually seeks the most effective means of using to generate more market value.

The work, which is expected to take two to three weeks, will be carried out from the special ship Normand Tonjer , which was converted into a mapping vessel a few years ago and is fitted with state-of-the-art equipment such as remote-controlled subsea tools, multi-beam echo sounders, side scan sonar and video cameras. The mapping will be followed by geotechnical surveys on the field and along the pipeline routes. Gisle Håland, coordinator for these surveys, explains that samples will be taken from the upper layers of the seabed at the Snøhvit and Albatross deposits and along the pipeline routes between the subsea installations and Melkøya. This work will be carried out from the special ship Bucentaur . The geotechnical surveys are estimated to last three weeks starting in mid-July.

       " 'Prize for diving research Alf O Brubakk (61) has been awarded Statoil’s research prize for 2001 for his many years of research within diving technology and physiological effects on divers. The prizewinner has been particularly concerned with how diving affects the divers’ health. His work has contributed to responsible standards for diving activities in the oil industry, according to the judges. Professor Brubakk works at the Institute for Physiology and Biomedical Technology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. He is known in Norway and abroad for his research within physiological response in extreme environments and biomedical instrumentation. Einar Wold Svendsen, adviser in diving technology in Statoil, says that most oil companies acknowledge the need for diving as a method of carrying out tasks. The diver still outperforms remote-controlled technology when unexpected incidents occur. Furthermore, divers play an important role in connection with emergency response. Mr Brubakk kept up his research into diving medical treatment even when discontinuing manned underwater operations was being considered. The research prize of NOK 200,000 was presented yesterday at Statoil’s research centre in Trondheim. This was the 11th time the prize has been awarded and it is recognition of research results achieved at a high international level within a specialist area considered to be important for Statoil.

       " 'Profile: Hilde Myrberg, new head of Hydro Energy Work has to be meaningful and stimulating, and in Hydro Energy it certainly is, says Hilde Myrberg, who on 1 June was made president of the Hydro Energy business sector. Hilde Myrberg comes well prepared to the top job in Hydro Energy: in the course of her 17 years in Hydro, she has accumulated a lot of valuable experience through working as company secretary, as a lawyer handling negotiations, both in and outside of Norway, for agriculture, aluminium, oil and energy plus petrochemicals. Her most recent position was head of power procurement and marketing in Hydro Energy. \"The advantage of such a varied background is that it gives one the broad picture,\" states Myrberg, who studied law at Oslo University and holds a Master of Business Administration from Insead in France. Competition in the gas market \"Now that the Norwegian Gas Negotiating Committee is history, oil companies have to start competing for customers. One of the most important tasks for Hydro Energy is to consolidate Hydro\\'s position in the new de-regulated gas market,\" says Myrberg, adding that it is necessary to establish systems and routines in order to meet the new challenges. She is convinced that the company has a strong platform for competing, even with the major players. \"Hydro can be a niche player in areas where one is not dependent on particular economies of scale. For example, the household market is not for us. But we have considerable advantages in the industrial market because we already supply major internal customers on the continent - and have done so in the electrical power market for quite some time.\" Beneficial and profitable Renewable energy, including hydrogen, is another area where Hydro Energy is involved. But any commercial ventures resulting from this engagement will have to be profitable: \"We wish to concentrate on areas that are beneficial to society, and where we earn money - making our work more enjoyable and more rewarding. It is important, for the company and its employees, that the work is meaningful,\" adds Myrberg, who is keen to see opportunities grasped throughout the organization. \"There are a lot of talented employees in Hydro Energy. Preparing the ground to utilize the full potential of our organization is a major challenge and a great responsibility. We need to ask ourselves whether we are communicating our strategy well enough so that all employees recognize their part in it, and whether the organization\\'s division of roles and responsibilities is clear. At the same time we need to make the most of the expertise available throughout the organization - avoiding blinkered thinking and considering alternatives.\" Myrberg summarizes the demands on the organization as follows: \"To work in a focused and enthusiastic way towards the goals we have set ourselves.\" Reading Myrberg has two daughters of 11 and 14 and has set up a domestic organization which takes in a Polish student as homehelp, and the sharing of responsibilities and tasks between husband and wife. This is necessary, she says, for anybody whose spouse is not at home on a full-time or part-time basis. In her spare time she unwinds by going skiing or cycling near her home in Sørkedalen on the outskirts of Oslo. She is also a member of a reading circle, and sets aside time to pursue her literary interests. She would appear to belong to the small minority of Norwegian top managers who would be able to answer the question: \"What book(s) do you currently have on your bedside table?\" without having to churn out Hamsun, other high school syllabus favourites or popular management textbooks. Her reading over recent months has taken in modern fiction and books on foreign cultures - India, South America, Asia - and Islam. Why does she read? \"To obtain different stimuli and gain a broader perspective.\" Work has to be meaningful and stimulating, and in Hydro Energy it certainly is, says Hilde Myrberg, who on 1 June was made president of the Hydro Energy business sector.

She is convinced that the company has a strong platform for competing, even with the major players. \"Hydro can be a niche player in areas where one is not dependent on particular economies of scale. For example, the household market is not for us. But we have considerable advantages in the industrial market because we already supply major internal customers on the continent - and have done so in the electrical power market for quite some time.\" Beneficial and profitable Renewable energy, including hydrogen, is another area where Hydro Energy is involved. But any commercial ventures resulting from this engagement will have to be profitable: \"We wish to concentrate on areas that are beneficial to society, and where we earn money - making our work more enjoyable and more rewarding. It is important, for the company and its employees, that the work is meaningful,\" adds Myrberg, who is keen to see opportunities grasped throughout the organization. \"There are a lot of talented employees in Hydro Energy. Preparing the ground to utilize the full potential of our organization is a major challenge and a great responsibility. We need to ask ourselves whether we are communicating our strategy well enough so that all employees recognize their part in it, and whether the organization\\'s division of roles and responsibilities is clear. At the same time we need to make the most of the expertise available throughout the organization - avoiding blinkered thinking and considering alternatives.\" Myrberg summarizes the demands on the organization as follows: \"To work in a focused and enthusiastic way towards the goals we have set ourselves.\" Reading Myrberg has two daughters of 11 and 14 and has set up a domestic organization which takes in a Polish student as homehelp, and the sharing of responsibilities and tasks between husband and wife. This is necessary, she says, for anybody whose spouse is not at home on a full-time or part-time basis. In her spare time she unwinds by going skiing or cycling near her home in Sørkedalen on the outskirts of Oslo. She is also a member of a reading circle, and sets aside time to pursue her literary interests. She would appear to belong to the small minority of Norwegian top managers who would be able to answer the question: \"What book(s) do you currently have on your bedside table?\" without having to churn out Hamsun, other high school syllabus favourites or popular management textbooks. Her reading over recent months has taken in modern fiction and books on foreign cultures - India, South America, Asia - and Islam. Why does she read? \"To obtain different stimuli and gain a broader perspective.\"',\n",
       " 'Hydro Oil & Energy increases annual production growth rate Hydro has revised its production profile and average annual production growth rate during the period 2001 to 2005 to 8%. This is a substantial increase from the previously reported 5 - 6%. The purchase in March, from the Norwegian State Direct Financial Interests (SDFI) of eight production licences in the Oseberg, Tune and Grane fields, is the main reason for adjusting the production growth rate. The purchase is now fully approved and completed. The deal increases Hydro\\'s interests in these fields, which they operate, to 34% in Oseberg, 40% in Tune and 38% in Grane. The additional production will be incorporated into Hydro\\'s results from May 10 and will result in raising Hydro\\'s forecast production target for this year from 430,000 barrels of equivalents per day (boe/d) to 455,000 boe/d. The production estimate is based on Norwegian production curtails for the first six months of this year. Approximately 12% of Hydro\\'s total production in 2005 is forecast to come from outside of Norway. \"We expect to see an increasing part of our production, investments and activity in areas outside of Norway in the years to come\", said President of Hydro\\'s Oil and Energy business unit, Tore Torvund. \"At the same time we are confident that Hydro’s positions in deep water on the Norwegian Shelf and downstream into the European gas market, will provide good business opportunities for the company\", he said.

       " 'Electrolysers: Hydrogen filling station contract in Hamburg Norsk Hydro Electrolysers AS has signed a contract with Hamburgische Electricitäts-Werke AG (HEW) on the supply of a hydrogen filling station. CUTE (Clean Urban Transport Europe) is a demonstration project on the use of hydrogen as fuel in 27 buses in nine European cities. Norsk Hydro Electrolysers was chosen by HEW because of its profound knowledge of electrolysers. This is of major importance to guarantee a continuous operation of the hydrogen refueling station in Hamburg for the CUTE-Project. A filling station will be delivered fully assembled in Hamburg in April 2003. The trial period for the use of hydrogen in buses stretches over a three-year period. The EU-supported CUTE project is the first of this size to demonstrate the use of hydrogen as fuel in the transport sector. Icelandic New Energy Ltd. has also chosen NHEL also to supply a similar hydrogen filling station to the Icelandic ECTOS program. ECTOS is a \"sister\" program to CUTE. One hydrogen fueling station and three hydrogen buses shall be operated in Reykjavik beginning third quarter 2003. Hydrogen is a carbon-free energy carrier and may become the fuel of choice in future transport solutions. Electrolysers need only water and electricity to produce hydrogen. A hydrogen filling station can therefore produce hydrogen locally and vehicles can be filled in the same way as at today\\'s gas stations.

       " 'Green energy in demand An environment-friendly energy supply solution ordered by Selmer Skanska Bolig from Statoil is the latest in a series of such contracts recently won by the group. The latest assignment covers a combination of seawater-based heat pumps with propane burners in reserve to provide space heating and hot water for a new 300-flat complex in Stavanger. This contract represents the first for Statoil based on combining heat pumps and propane. Other recent jobs include heating based on heat pumps for student bed-sitters at Bjølsen in Oslo, which is due to begin operating this autumn. And a heat pump operated by Statoil was inaugurated a month ago at Gipø nursing home in Nøtterøy local authority south of Oslo. “We’ve noted a growing interest in what we have to offer,” says Geir Gransbråten, manager of energy solutions in the Nordic energy business cluster. “That’s because customers can see they get secure energy deliveries not only on competitive terms but also in an environment-friendly way.” Statoil is concentrating on persuading housing complexes, hotels, hospitals and other medium-sized electricity consumers to purchase integrated energy solutions developed and marketed by the group. These deliveries include operation and maintenance of the facilities, and Statoil guarantees that charges will correspond to the lower of electricity or heating-oil prices at any time. Mr Gransbråten explains that propane will be used in the Stavanger project for more than heating and hot water. Residents can also opt to have gas hobs, fireplaces or barbecues installed. “Combining heat pumps and propane satisfies two trends at the same time by meeting both environmental concerns and requirements for comfort.” The first and second stages of this housing complex will be ready in the summer of 2003, and the agreement with Selmer runs for 18 years.

       " 'Clean-up centre opened A new oil-spill response centre was opened at Statoil’s Mongstad facility north of Bergen today, 5 June, by Norwegian petroleum and energy minister Einar Steensnæs. Bringing all clean-up equipment under one roof, this building ensures that the port is better placed to prevent and deal with oil spills. A demonstration of the equipment – including a newly-developed skimmer – was staged after the opening ceremony for Mr Steensnæs, local politicians and other guests. The Slurpen skimmer collects oil and other pollutants from the sea and shore zone. With a draught of only 1.35 metres, it can work right up to the beach. Statoil has been actively involved in developing this vessel, which is the first unit of its kind to come into commercial operation. The new response centre occupies a strategic position alongside the outermost of the two tug jetties at the Port of Mongstad . A large mobile clean-up barge able to hold up to 2,500 cubic metres of collected oil is also stationed there. Guests at the opening were also shown the port’s four modern and well-equipped tugs, which provide escort, towing and emergency response services. The high-speed command vessel Raffen impressed the audience with its two powerful engines and crane. “This is one of Europe’s busiest oil ports,” comments Nils-Bjørn Jordal, vice president for refining in Statoil. “It’s also going to be the safest, which is why we’ve built up an extensive oil-spill response with ultra-modern equipment and trained personnel. “However, the most important job is to implement preventive measures which can ensure that accidents don’t happen.” Equipment for cleaning up oil spills was previously spread around various parts of the facility. In addition to becoming more easily available, it has been upgraded and supplemented. Part of the hardware is installed in containers which can be transported by helicopter to the site of a spill.

The contracts cover all of Statoil’s activities on the Norwegian continental shelf. With an estimated value of NOK 100 million (Aker Maritime) and NOK 50 million (Smedvig), the contracts are for a three-year period with two-by-two year options. “The work covers wireline well intervention and will be carried out mainly in connection with the maintenance of production wells and preparing new wells. Wireline operations will include running perforation guns, setting plugs, logging and the installation of downhole safety valves,” explains Lars Fredrik Gjeruldsen, contract coordinator in Statoil. He adds that the contracts also include an option to purchase well tractor services. A well tractor is an electrically operated tool that pulls equipment through in horizontal wells. Aker Maritime will be responsible for the Tampen area and parts of Halten Nordland. Due to the increased field portfolio in Tampen following the operatorship takeover from Norsk Hydro at the end of the year, the value of the contracts will be higher from 2003. For Smedvig Brønntjenester the contract covers the Sleipner/Troll area as well as the Åsgard, Kristin and Mikkel fields in Halten Nordland. In addition, Smedvig will be responsible for well interventions in all Statoil exploration wells on the Norwegian continental shelf, and outside Norway if this is considered appropriate. Statoil has awarded Aker Maritime Well Services and Smedvig Brønntjenester contracts for drilling and well services. The contracts cover all of Statoil’s activities on the Norwegian continental shelf. With an estimated value of NOK 100 million (Aker Maritime) and NOK 50 million (Smedvig), the contracts are for a three-year period with two-by-two year options. “The work covers wireline well intervention and will be carried out mainly in connection with the maintenance of production wells and preparing new wells. Wireline operations will include running perforation guns, setting plugs, logging and the installation of downhole safety valves,” explains Lars Fredrik Gjeruldsen, contract coordinator in Statoil. He adds that the contracts also include an option to purchase well tractor services. A well tractor is an electrically operated tool that pulls equipment through in horizontal wells.

       " 'Green light for Snøhvit Based on the information received from the Efta Surveillance Authorities (ESA) 31 May, the Snøhvit partners are preparing to proceed with the Snøhvit project. The partners in Snøhvit , with Statoil as operator, resolved on 21 March to halt work on the project at Melkøya outside Hammerfest in northern Norway until the ESA had clarified the framework terms. Activity at the Melkøya site will now be resumed as quickly as possible, reports Snøhvit project director Egil Gjesteland. Snøhvit licensees holding individual sales deals with customers in the USA and Spain have been able to remove conditional clauses in their contracts. “We’re relieved at this clarification and look forward to getting the project restarted,” says Mr Gjesteland.

       " 'Paving the way for Kvitebjørn Statoil has commenced the construction of a landfall tunnel at Kollsnes near Bergen to receive the gas pipeline from the Kvitebjørn field in the North Sea. An improved landfall solution has led to considerable cost savings for the project. The new solution means that the pipeline will be installed on the seabed closer to land than planned and involves the construction of a 400-metre landfall tunnel to Storholmen west of the gas terminal at Kollsnes , reports Jostein Breivik, project manager for the pipelines in the Kvitebjørn development. By choosing this option the project is saving around NOK 175 million. In the course of the summer months in 2003 a laying barge will lay the pipeline from the Kvitebjørn field to Kollsnes and pull it through the tunnel to the terminal. The original plan was based on extending the existing landfall tunnels for the pipelines to Kollsnes. This solution would require an extra 1,400 metres of tunnel and two kilometres of pipeline. The Kvitebjørn project is on schedule. The platform deck with drilling package is about 60 per cent complete. The jacket is almost finished and will be installed on the North Sea field in September this year. The deck will be lifted into place in March 2003. The Kvitebjørn field will supply gas from 1 October 2004. Gas and condensate will be transported in separate pipelines to Kollsnes and the Mongstad refinery respectively for further treatment.

       " \"Gas supply to Dutch horticulture industry Hydro Energy, ENECO and AgroEnergy have entered into a gas agreement to supply gas to the Dutch horticulture industry. The deal entails supplying nearly one billion cubic meters of natural gas to some 560 greenhouses in The Netherlands. Deliveries started January 1, 2002 and have an initial duration of one year. The supply agreement is based on each party's core competence, creating the most competitive arrangement for the end-consumer. As the third-largest energy distribution company in the Netherlands, ENECO represents the link between a broad network of end-consumers and Hydro Energy's organization, more tailored to large end-consumers and the wholesale segment. AgroEnergy is a joint venture between Rabobank and the Dutch agricultural organization LTO Nederland (Land-en tuinbouw Organisatie), offering greenhouses joint energy purchases. In its first year of existence, AgroEnergy already represents some 25 percent of the horticultural segment in respect of energy purchases. Hydro Energy is the commercial arm of the oil and energy business area of the Norwegian industrial company Norsk Hydro. Hydro's two other core areas are aluminium and plant nutrition. After having built a market position in the large industrial segment in recent years, Hydro Energy has further strengthened its position in the Dutch gas market with its supplies to greenhouses. This gas sales agreement makes Norsk Hydro an all-round partner for the Dutch horticulture industry, and is complimentary to its already well-established position as supplier of specialty fertilizers through HydroAgri's Substrafeed program and supply of liquid carbon dioxide through its subsidiary Hydro Gas and Chemicals B.V.

       " \"Revised targets for production A new Statoil production target for 2007 was unveiled by chief executive Olav Fjell today, 29 May, during the Capital Market Day presentation. Almost 100 investors, analysts and journalists are attending this meeting to learn about the group’s strategic opportunities and future challenges. At 1.26 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, the 2007 target represents an extension of the existing 2004 goal and assumes that output will continue to grow by four per cent annually. Statoil’s ambition is to double production from its international operations during the period, while maintaining output from the Norwegian continental shelf at one million barrels per day. “The NCS still offers great opportunities for a long time to come,” Mr Fjell emphasised. He added that Statoil aims to keep NCS output at a million barrels per day beyond 2007, but that this would be conditional on access to promising new exploration acreage. “We’ve been through an extraordinary year since our stock market listing, but the group is sticking to the 2004 targets it communicated during the initial public offering,” Mr Fjell said. Statoil has improved its competitiveness through cost reductions totalling NOK 4 billion since 1998. It has also become 50 per cent bigger by acquiring part of the state’s direct financial interest (SDFI) in Norwegian petroleum operations. Mr Fjell also noted that earnings must rise by NOK 3.5 billion to meet the commitment to a 12 per cent return on capital employed. Click here to see the key figures. As a main player in the European gas market, Statoil will be involved in a liberalisation process with more gas sold spot. Mr Fjell also wanted to see a substantial increase in sales to the UK. By 2012, he hoped that the group would derive 40 per cent of its oil and gas production from international operations – compared to a target of 10 per cent in 2004. This depended on Statoil changing from a regional oil company under strong government influence to a world-class international oil and gas operator in selected areas.

Why the runaway slaves chose this place as their hide-out can be guessed from the name of the place – “boa vista” – good view. The green banks rising up from the river plateau offer some good lookouts where the fugitives could observe people approaching without been seen themselves. “Even today, people here have this tendency to withdraw and check things out before coming forward to greet strangers,” says José de Melo, one of the leaders of the Boa Vista cooperative and himself a descendant of “quilombolas” – fugitive black slaves. Boa Vista is on the Mineração Rio do Norte list of social activities programs, covering health care and education as well as smaller business projects, including research into the effects of local plants on different ailments. Local people have remedies against gastritis and rheumatism, for example, knowledge that has been passed on from one generation to the next, Melo explains. This is no surprise – after all, it was Amazon Indians who first extracted quinine from cinchona bark to be used against malaria.

Social responsibility programs in Brazilian industrial companies range from free or highly subsidized medical and dental care for employees and their families to training and even basic education. Didn’t you finish high school? Our company offers you a chance to pick up where you left. “An industrial company is part of the community and cannot survive without social engagement. This is, I think, an investment that a company which wants to be respected has to make,” says Ademar Cavalcanti Silva Filho, administration and human resources manager at MRN (Mineração Rio do Norte) in Trombetas, Pará. For MRN, corporate social responsibility is not something new and trendy, Silva says. The company began its community and social activities long before the term was created. In the mining district of Trombetas, MRN has constructed a town which in December 2001 gained the international ISO 14000 grade – the only town in the western hemisphere that has received this distinction, Silva proudly proclaims. In a town that boasts a zero crime rate, the 7,000 inhabitants benefit from good housing, schools, medical care as well as a social club offering a wide range of sports and other activities. In addition, the company invests some $80,000 per year on social programs aimed at the people living along the river. Almost half is spent on education. Each year, about 2,000 youngsters – representing 35 percent of the local population – have their education partially financed by MRN. But it doesn’t stop there: MRN also offers training in technical subjects and contributes money to students who will continue on to college. Even those who grew up before MRN started its programs aren’t forgotten. If they cannot read or write, they are offered a literacy program. So while Colete, a daughter of a family along the Trombetas, has been educated and has found a job as a technician, her parents are attending a course to learn to read and write. Social spirit Also in the state of Pará, the two aluminium companies – Alunorte and Albras – provide extensive social assistance. According to Paulo Ivan Faria Campo, public relations manager at Albras, the company has spent about $1.2 million per year in social assistance programs for the last 15 years. This public spirit has also spread to employees. When a TV report last year showed the shockingly high rate of serious injuries in small brick manufacturing plants in the region, technicians and engineers at Albras volunteered to reconstruct the brick extruders to prevent physical injuries. In a fairly short time they came up with technical solutions to the problem. In cooperation with municipal and state authorities, Alunorte is engaged in the Barcarena of the Future project, aiming to develop production activities in six neighboring communities. One of the agricultural cooperatives has started a plant nursery which will provide the farmers with seedlings. The surplus is to be sold in the open market.

       " \"Focus: 25 years in Brazil Since the start-up 25 years ago, Hydro's activities in Brazil have grown significantly. With current domestic sales of USD 250 million, total exports of USD 250 million, 13 locations and 1,100 employees, Hydro has become an important player in Brazil. The company holds a market share of 12 percent in the aluminum business in Brazil and an estimated market share of 9 percent in the Brazilian fertilizer market. Hydro is also considering Brazil as a possible area for future oil and gas activities. Norsk Hydro opened shop in Brazil in 1977 in Rio de Janeiro as Hydro Comércio & Indústria Ltda., three years after its first investment – a 5 percent stake in the bauxite mines of Mineração Rio do Norte in Trombetas, Pará. The first order of business back then was to gain a foothold for Hydro and Qatar Fertilizer Co. (Qafco) in the Brazilian fertilizer market, not only one of the biggest fertilizer markets in the world but at that time also a major market for urea imports. Hydro had a 25 percent stake in Qafco, and marketed its entire urea production. In addition, the Rio office looked after Hydro’s interest in MRN. In 1983, Hydro decided to move its activities to São Paulo, where most fertilizer importers were located. Besides, the state of São Paulo was the biggest market for imported fertilizers in the country, including urea, says Audun Sørbotten, the Hydro Agri executive who pioneered Hydro’s foray into Brazil. Well aware of the importance of cooperation with local business, the newcomer courted national producers and importers. The company was already cooperating with Adubos Trevo, one of its long-time Brazilian customers. In 2000, almost a quarter of a century later, Hydro took control of the Porto Alegre-based company, which now proudly displays two logos: Adubos Trevo and Hydro. Today, Hydro’s ambition in Brazil remains the same: To grow in the fertilizer and aluminium markets in Brazil. Since the start-up 25 years ago, Hydro's activities in Brazil have grown significantly. With current domestic sales of USD 250 million, total exports of USD 250 million, 13 locations and 1,100 employees, Hydro has become an important player in Brazil.

Norsk Hydro opened shop in Brazil in 1977 in Rio de Janeiro as Hydro Comércio & Indústria Ltda., three years after its first investment – a 5 percent stake in the bauxite mines of Mineração Rio do Norte in Trombetas, Pará. The first order of business back then was to gain a foothold for Hydro and Qatar Fertilizer Co. (Qafco) in the Brazilian fertilizer market, not only one of the biggest fertilizer markets in the world but at that time also a major market for urea imports. Hydro had a 25 percent stake in Qafco, and marketed its entire urea production. In addition, the Rio office looked after Hydro’s interest in MRN. In 1983, Hydro decided to move its activities to São Paulo, where most fertilizer importers were located. Besides, the state of São Paulo was the biggest market for imported fertilizers in the country, including urea, says Audun Sørbotten, the Hydro Agri executive who pioneered Hydro’s foray into Brazil. Well aware of the importance of cooperation with local business, the newcomer courted national producers and importers. The company was already cooperating with Adubos Trevo, one of its long-time Brazilian customers. In 2000, almost a quarter of a century later, Hydro took control of the Porto Alegre-based company, which now proudly displays two logos: Adubos Trevo and Hydro. Today, Hydro’s ambition in Brazil remains the same: To grow in the fertilizer and aluminium markets in Brazil.\",\n",
       " 'Top marks for Statoil Norwegian economics and technology students in their final year rank Statoil at the top of their list of employers they would like to work for, according to Universum Graduate Study. The survey was carried out among university and college students in Norway. Companies who are popular with the students have one thing in common – they visit university and college campuses where they hold presentations and offer trainee programmes. Anne Bjerkelund Selvig, manager for personnel planning in human resources, believes that the positive result is mainly due to focused recruitment. \"We are active and very conscious of how we present Statoil at universities and colleges,\" says Ms Selvig. \"It’s an ongoing process.” The survey shows that students consider Norwegian companies to be more attractive than before, whereas large consultant companies are losing ground. The students’ preferences reflect the changing economic climate. This year’s survey shows that students are looking for job security more than they used to. It also shows that a famous name is not enough on its own to attract the students, who are now concerned about flexible work hours and job satisfaction. They are looking for jobs where they can develop on a professional level and will look into a company to see if it offers training programmes through which they can develop their skills. The results of the survey show that confidence in the industry has been re-established. When 18,000 jobs disappeared over 18 months as a result of low oil prices a couple of years ago, students became wary of the oil and gas industry. Today 74,000 people work in the Norwegian oil industry. Thirty years after the Oil Age came to Norway many of the pioneers are approaching retirement age. According to an estimate by the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF), the industry will need about 50,000 new employees over the next 20 years.

       " 'Magnificent farewell concert with Mariss Jansons On Tuesday evening the Oslo Philharmonic and main sponsor Norsk Hydro invited special guests to a farewell concert in Oslo to pay tribute to a conductor who has developed the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra over the last 23 years to become one of the world\\'s leading orchestras. The king and queen joined in the thunderous applause for Mariss Jansons. Mariss Jansons has laid his baton to rest as music director of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. At the end of May this visionary director conducted his last concerts in Oslo with the Oslo Philharmonic. Since 1979, Mariss Jansons has led the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra to become one of the orchestras in greatest demand at the most prominent musical arenas in the world and in the international recorded music market. The sponsorship collaboration with Hydro has provided the financial backing for the realization of the orchestra\\'s increasing artistic potential. Through the sole sponsorship agreement with Hydro since 1990, the orchestra\\'s international status has made a great contribution to promoting Norwegian business interests all over the world, and has boosted Norway\\'s prestige in many areas. Tuesday\\'s concert was an outstanding experience, not least as King Harald and Queen Sonja attended to honor the eminent conductor. Among the other prominent guests were representatives for the Government with the Minister for Cultural Affairs, Valgerd Svarstad Haugland, at the forefront, the president of the Storting and several members of the Storting, the mayor of Oslo and a number of prominent representatives of Norwegian society and culture. Hydro\\'s president and CEO Eivind Reiten was one of many speakers who thanked Mariss Jansons at the end of the concert for his achievements. In an emotional speech of thanks, Jansons described the Oslo Philharmonic as a national treasure, and pointed out that it would not have been possible to achieve such international recognition without the support of a sole sponsor of Hydro\\'s format. The concert program was the same as Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic will perform at their 14th concert in Vienna\\'s Musikverein in June - Jean Sibelius\\' Symphony no. 2, Albert Roussel\\'s Symphony no. 3, and Maurice Ravel\\'s \"Daphnis and Chloé\", suite no. 2. The applause went on for ever. As soon as the farewell concerts are over in Oslo, Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra will make their last tour together. They will visit Prague and Ljubljana for the first time, and then will end the tour in Vienna with two concerts at the Musikverein, in the \"golden\" hall where Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic have been warmly received since 1985. Hydro has invited a number of its contacts and business connections to the concerts in both Prague and Vienna. \"Magic moments with Mariss Jansons and the Oslo Philharmonic\" \"Throughout the 12 years Hydro has been sole sponsor of the Oslo Philharmonic, I have, together with many of the company\\'s customers and contacts, had the pleasure of attending numerous concerts with Mariss Jansons and the orchestra in Norway and abroad. They have all given Hydro\\'s guests, and me personally, exceptional musical experiences.

       " 'Dolphin charter terminated A charter with rig contractor Dolphin for the Byford Dolphin drilling unit has been terminated by Statoil. “Safety on this rig does not meet contractual requirements, and new measures adopted after a fatal accident on 17 April have not been satisfactorily followed up,” says Henrik Carlsen, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. Although the termination takes effect immediately, operations on Byford Dolphin will be wound down in a safe way. The charter originally ran until 8 October. The rig was working on Esso’s Sigyn discovery in the Norwegian North Sea when a 44-year-old man died. Statoil is drilling on behalf of Esso because Sigyn will be tied back to its Sleipner East field. An investigation launched by Statoil after the accident has now reported. It identified the direct cause of the incident as a spool piece weighing almost 200 kilograms falling through a hole in the drill floor onto a working platform nearly 14 metres below. The accident was triggered by the hole in the drill floor being inadequately secured. However, the report concluded that the underlying factors included inadequate planning, insufficient understanding of risk, and failure to ensure that procedures were observed. In addition, communication on the rig relating to work being carried out was deficient. After the accident, Statoil, Esso and Dolphin agreed to implement a number of immediate measures in order to bring the rig back into work. Byford Dolphin was shut down for seven days. “Safety has a high priority in Statoil, but our investigation shows that we failed to live up to our own targets on this occasion,” says Mr Carlsen. “The accident will have consequences for the supervision of our operations on drilling units.” He emphasises that Statoil has now implemented a number of in-house measures. The drilling superintendent function will be strengthened and rig supervision better coordinated, for instance. Supervisors will also devote more time and energy to practical efforts relating to health, safety and the environment out on the rigs.

Entitled “Statoil’s collection of art”, the show is drawn from one of the largest corporate collections of contemporary Norwegian art in the country. The presentation embraces about 40 of the roughly 2,000 registered artworks held by the group, and mostly comprises paintings with a few small sculptures. “A large number of outsiders have asked us to put our collection on display,” explains Statoil art consultant Wenche Falkenhaug. “Employees are also interested in seeing these things exhibited, and it’s fun to bring the works more alive by putting them on show in an art institution.” She explains that objects have been selected for display to illustrate the breadth of the group’s collection, and are by some of Norway’s best-known artists as well as several younger names. They include Bjørn-Sigurd Tufta, Frans Widerberg, Per Kleiva, Vegard Moen, Torbjørn Rødland, Terje Finnsen and Vibeke Slyngstad. The artworks on show include pictures loaned to the Norwegian embassy in Berlin and others which embellish Statoil offices outside Stavanger. “It’s fun to show part of our collection to local people,” says Ms Falkenhaug. “This is usually only accessible to employees or visitors. And the exhibition coincides with our 30th anniversary.” Statoil's art purchases have had a consistent focus on contemporary works.

       " 'Two finds on Tampen Operator Statoil has proven gas condensate and light oil in two wells drilled close to the Gullfaks and Statfjord fields in the North Sea. Exploration well 33/12-8S was drilled in the Dole prospect, while well 33/12-8A was drilled in the Ole prospect. Both wells lie in production licence 152. Hydrocarbons were proven in Middle Jurassic rocks in the wells. Due to similarities with the Rimfaks and Gullveig producing fields, the wells were not production tested. Well 33/12-8S was drilled to 3,350 metres below mean sea level, and 33/12-8A was drilled to 3,369 metres. The latter was temporarily abandoned and will come on stream at a later stage. Both wells were drilled with the Borgland Dolphin rig. “We have started a project to evaluate potential tie-back points for the new finds. If they are profitable, we expect them to produce from 2004,” reports Bengt Beskow, exploration manager for the Tampen area. The finds lie about 16 kilometres from both the Statfjord B platform and the Gullfaks A platform. The distance between Ole and Dole is around 1,700 metres. Two development alternatives are being evaluated. The finds could be tied back via subsea templates on the Gullfaks South satellite field and then on to Gullfaks C, or they could be tied back to the Statfjord B platform. Statoil will be the sole operator for the Tampen area when the group takes over Snorre, Visund, Vigdis and Tordis from Norsk Hydro on 1 January 2003. The group therefore wants to search for and develop small finds in the area in order to extend production from the Tampen platforms. The licensees in production licence 152 are Statoil (58.89 per cent), Petoro (30 per cent) and ExxonMobil (11.11 per cent). Statoil has entered into an agreement to take over ExxonMobil’s stake with effect from 1 January 2002. The agreement is expected to be approved by the authorities before the summer.

       " 'Record gas sales Equity gas sales by Statoil averaged 52.4 million cubic metres per day during the first quarter of 2002, up by almost 30 per cent from the same period last year. An average of 40.9 million cubic metres of equity gas was sold by the group during January-March 2001. One important reason for the increase is that sales contracts with BP and ENI (Snam) came into effect with the start of the new gas year on 1 October. The BP agreement commits Statoil to supplying gas to the UK until 2015, while the ENI deal covers deliveries to Italy until 2025. In addition come rising delivery commitments under the group’s other long-term contracts after 1 October, reports Reidar Gudmestad, head of Statoil’s gas sales centre. The weather is a third factor responsible for boosting sales. “Last year’s winter was unusually mild in continental Europe, and our customers used their contractual flexibility to take lower volumes in January-March 2001,” says Mr Gudmestad.

       " 'Regularity high in first quarter A record for regularity in oil production was set on the Norwegian offshore fields operated by Statoil during the first quarter of 2002. Their installations produced for 94 per cent of the available time, an increase of two per cent from the same period of last year. “Every improvement in production regularity means millions of kroner in additional revenues,” says Henrik Carlsen, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. “We’ve recently been working systematically to avoid operational shut-downs on our fields, and these efforts are now bearing fruit.” Average production of oil and condensate by the group increased from 748,000 barrels oil per day in January-March 2001 to 761,000 this year. Norway’s overall offshore output declined during the first quarter because of a production cutback imposed by the authorities. But production regularity does not reflect loss of output from this curb. Overall, Statoil set a production record in the first quarter, with oil and gas output averaging 1,096,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. That compares with 1,005,000 barrels for the corresponding period last year, representing an improvement of nine per cent. The main reasons for the rise include a substantial increase in gas production from Norwegian fields and rising oil output from international operations, as well as the good regularity. “Unfortunately we suffered a setback on the health, safety and environmental side, with a fatal accident on Byford Dolphin on 17 April,” observes Mr Carlsen. The drilling rig was operating on the Sigyn field in the North Sea when the incident occurred. However, overall progress for injuries was recorded by Statoil during the first quarter. The total recordable injury frequency – the number of injuries to group employees and contractor personnel per million working hours – declined from 7.9 per cent in January-March 2001 to 4.9 this year. Actual recordable injuries fell from 132 to 84, while serious incidents were down from 90 to 70.

       " 'Hunting for oil in deep water More than 320 kilometers out in the Gulf of Mexico, Hydro is looking for oil in the deepest-ever well in the area. The \"Deepwater Pathfinder\" is drilling an exploration well in Walker Ridge 285. This well will be the deepest ever drilled in the Gulf of Mexico in terms of total depth - the water depth is 6,654 feet (2,016 meters), with a planned total drilling depth of around 31,000 feet (9,400 meters). The drill ship\\'s dimensions were impressive too, allowing it to drill in up to 7,500 feet of water. Hydro is a 25 percent partner in this Conoco-operated well. In addition to being deep, it is expensive, but also with high potential. Hunting for oil in the Gulf of Mexico is yet another move in the internationalization of Hydro\\'s oil and gas activities. Having been active on the Norwegian continental shelf for more than 30 years, Norsk Hydro is now aggressively building oil and gas exploration and production portfolios outside Norway. The Gulf of Mexico is the latest addition. The intention is that the new business unit - Norsk Hydro E&P America - will strengthen, diversify and grow Hydro\\'s exploration and production activities. Why has Norsk Hydro found the mature Gulf of Mexico an interesting area? \"We believe there is still potential for making significant commercial discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and that we will be among the ones to do it,\" explains Erik Finnstrøm, exploration manager in the Gulf of Mexico business unit. Even after many years of offshore exploration and production, the Gulf of Mexico still has a large remaining deep-water volume of remaining reserves to be produced - 14.6 billion barrels of undiscovered oil, according to WoodMacKenzie. For comparison, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate estimates that there are 19.2 million barrels of remaining reserves on the Norwegian continental shelf. The Gulf of Mexico is an area where Hydro has a potential to build on the company\\'s strong offshore expertise. Additionally, the area offers investors a stable and attractive fiscal regime. The Gulf of Mexico is a dynamic region, a commercial and technological front-runner in many areas. As an oil company, Hydro will gain valuable knowledge and expertise from working in this region. The latest in technology is being applied to master the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling in deep water takes specialized equipment and skills. The drillship sported the latest outfitting and systems in drilling technology. After more than 20 years of deepwater exploration activity and production in the Gulf of Mexico starting in the late 1980s, the activity level is still high and expectations remain for new large finds. Around 600 exploration wells have been drilled to date at water depths greater than 400 meters, and in 2001, 93 exploration wells were drilled. Comparable numbers for the Norwegian continental shelf are a total of 24 exploration wells in water depths greater than 400 meters, and 28 exploration wells being drilled in 2001 in total in Norwegian waters. There are 530 oil-related companies in Houston, confirming the belief in the potential that the Gulf of Mexico still has to offer. Confirming also the extremely tough competition, but also the potential for Norsk Hydro to succeed and acquire knowledge that can be applied to oil and gas activities elsewhere. The joint venture with Conoco provides Hydro with a good exploration starting position. On September 5, 2001, Norsk Hydro and Conoco entered into a joint venture agreement. Five firm and three contingent exploration wells will be drilled under the agreement. A longer-term goal is to establish the Gulf of Mexico as a formal core area, with a production rate of at least 50,000 barrels per day. \"Success will require quick learning and hard work, but we all have the fire within to succeed,\" says Helge Hove Haldorsen, head of Hydro\\'s Gulf of Mexico business unit in Houston.

This facility forms part of the group’s efforts to reduce environmentally-harmful VOC emissions from oil loading and storage on fields off Norway. The Norwegian authorities have set an initial requirement that 40 per cent of offshore loading and storage operations must be free of VOC emissions by 31 December 2003. Installing the Norne plant means that Statoil has now met its part of the requirement. A similar facility is already located on the group’s Åsgard A oil production ship to the south of Norne. Both fields can accordingly load and store oil without VOC emissions. Two of the shuttle tankers lifting cargoes from Statoil fields also have VOC recovery plants, and facilities are under construction for two further vessels.

       " \"First quarter 2002: Weaker markets affect results Lower prices for Hydro's main products - aluminium, oil and fertilizer - contributed to a 34 percent decline in earnings in the first quarter of 2002. Net income in the first quarter of 2002 was NOK 2,132 million (NOK 8.30 per share) compared with NOK 3,235 million (NOK 12.40 per share) in the same period last year. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was NOK 8,588 million in the first quarter, compared to NOK 11,359 million in the same quarter last year. The decline is mainly due to lower prices for oil, gas and aluminium. For Aluminium , EBITDA was NOK 899 million, compared to NOK 1,430 million in the first quarter last year, primarily as a result of the significant economic downturn experienced during the second half of 2001. Hydro took over the German aluminium company VAW on March 15, 2002, so VAW operations are only included for the last two weeks of the quarter. Reorganization processes and the integration with VAW have resulted in a new segment structure. The figures from previous periods have been altered in the table to show comparable information. For the Oil and Energy sector, EBITDA was NOK 5,847 million for the first quarter, compared to NOK 7,894 million in the corresponding period last year. Hydro's oil and gas production was somewhat higher than last year, particularly internationally, as the Girassol field in Angola and Terra Nova in Canada came on stream at the beginning of the year. Oil production in Norway has, as forecast, been hit by the production constraints imposed by the Norwegian authorities (these are to expire at the end of the next quarter). Hydro signed an agreement in the first quarter on the acquisition of state ownership (SDFI) interests in important fields on the Norwegian continental shelf where Hydro is operator. The agreement will not affect the accounts and production figures until after completion, which is expected at the end of the first half year. The average crude oil price in the first quarter of 2002 was USD 21.10 per barrel, compared with USD 26.3 per barrel in the same period of the previous year. Measured in Norwegian kroner, the oil price declined by approximately 19 percent. EBITDA for Agri was NOK 1,383 million in the first quarter of 2002, compared to NOK 1,570 million in the first quarter of 2001. A considerable reduction in fertilizer prices has been offset by increased volumes, cost reductions and other improvement measures. EBITDA for Petrochemicals was NOK 28 million in the first quarter of 2002, compared to NOK 109 million the same period last year. The lower results were mainly due to a reduction in the price of S-PVC of approximately 22 percent compared with the same period of the prior year. The negative effect was partly offset by lower raw materials costs. Lower prices for Hydro's main products - aluminium, oil and fertilizer - contributed to a 34 percent decline in earnings in the first quarter of 2002. Net income in the first quarter of 2002 was NOK 2,132 million (NOK 8.30 per share) compared with NOK 3,235 million (NOK 12.40 per share) in the same period last year. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was NOK 8,588 million in the first quarter, compared to NOK 11,359 million in the same quarter last year. The decline is mainly due to lower prices for oil, gas and aluminium. For Aluminium , EBITDA was NOK 899 million, compared to NOK 1,430 million in the first quarter last year, primarily as a result of the significant economic downturn experienced during the second half of 2001.

       " 'Atlantis stake acquired A 12 per cent holding has been acquired by Statoil in Atlantis, a Norwegian company with a patented technology for deepwater drilling and production of oil and gas. This solution is based on reducing the distance between a floating installation and the bottom of the sea by installing an artificial seabed. A steel tank held at a depth of 300 metres provides a subsea platform for installing drilling and production equipment. That makes it possible to use known technology even when producing oil and gas located several kilometres beneath the surface of the sea. “This technology is being considered for a number of deepwater areas, both off Norway and internationally,” says Martin Sigmundstad, vice president for industrial development in Statoil. The concept is the brainchild of Terje Magnussen, who currently serves as technical vice president at Atlantis. He has previously worked in Statoil’s drilling technology department, and the group helped to develop his idea. The Atlantis approach allows rig operations to be carried out quickly and safely in deep water. This is partly because installation and operation of critical equipment are raised to a typical depth of 300 metres, with virtually unlimited access to qualified technology. BP and Shell are participating in planning and construction of the first Atlantis prototype, which will form the basis for possible use of the technology off western Africa.

The idea of producing hydrogen based on windpower is well-received by an environmental-conscious European public. During periods when electricity production exceeds demand, surplus electricity can be used in an electrolyser to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen can be stored and used in a fuel cell to produce electricity when there is no wind - or when demand exceeds supply because of other reasons. The stored hydrogen can also be used as fuel for vehicles and boats. The facility is scheduled to start operating by 2003. If successful, the solutions can be used globally.

       " 'Troll hits new oil output record Troll is now decidely the highest-producing oil field in the Norwegian offshore sector. A new production record of 444,204 barrels of oil per day was set on April 8. \"Keeping in mind many didn\\'t believe oil production on the Troll field could be done, this is a truly remarkable milestone,\" says Johan Kristian Mikkelsen, manager of Hydro\\'s Troll business unit. In addition to the combined production record on the Troll field, including both the Troll B and Troll C platforms, a new output high was also reached on Troll C of 224,886 barrels of oil per day. Troll lies at the top-tier of Norwegian offshore sector production concerning both oil and gas. This is the result of long-term technology development in both the operator company Hydro and its suppliers. It is first and foremost advanced drilling and well technology that explains how the Troll gas field is also Norway\\'s largest oil producer. New technology for drilling long horizontal wells has been decisive in producing oil from just 8-9 meter thick oil reservoir zones. There are 13 wells drilled on Troll with two lateral wells. \"Lateral wells are a means to significantly reducing costs per well. We\\'re now on the verge of drilling the first well with three lateral branches. This will be the first three-headed lateral well in the world drilled at sea.

       " 'Cause of Åsgard vibrations found Following an extensive test programme, operator Statoil has determined the cause of the vibrations in the export pipelines on the Åsgard B gas platform in the Norwegian Sea. “The vibrations occur as a result of acoustic waves produced when the gas flows over uneven surfaces inside the flexible riser from Åsgard B down to the seabed,” reports operations vice president Ola Krumsvik. He explains that the acoustic waves are transmitted to the platforms fixed pipe system and that vibrations occur due to resonance at certain wave frequencies. By making some alterations to the gas-carrying pipelines on board, the problem can be reduced without affecting export capacity. A system for monitoring the vibrations has been installed. On board, reinforcements have been carried out so that exports of gas now total more than 20 million scm per day. Further modifications will be made in June, when a third riser will also be installed. Statoil expects that Åsgard B will be in full production following the work in June. The platform will however undergo modification in September, in connection with a planned turnaround at the Kårstø gas reception terminal, north of Stavanger. Welding joints on the pipelines that connect the installations on the Åsgard field to the Smørbukk reservoir will also be rectified. So far, 46 of the 72 welds have been repaired, reports Idar O Grytdal, operations manager for the subsea installations. The repair work is very much dependent on weather conditions. Pipeline ends with poor welds are disconnected with the aid of remotely controlled subsea equipment before being raised to the surface for welding. Technically speaking, the repairs have gone according to plan, but bad weather has led to a slight delay. However, with efforts being made to catch up, the work should finish on schedule in the summer. Contracted gas volumes will be delivered with help from other fields in periods where Åsgard has redused export capacity.

Failure to clarify the framework terms means that these partners can not give final confirmation to the buyers and shipping companies within the deadline. Statoil is working for a postponement of the deadlines for the confirmation of the sales and shipping contracts. The partnership will also continue project preparations in accordance with current plans. Work at Melkøya, outside Hammerfest, will not be initiated and new commitments will not be made until the frame conditions with the authorities have been clarified.\",\n",
       " \"New standby vessel Statoil has awarded Simon Møkster Shipping the contract for building and operating a new standby vessel for the fields in the Halten/Nordland area of the Norwegian Sea . The contract is worth around NOK 600 million. Last year Statoil entered into a cooperation agreement with Shell and Norsk Hydro for shared standby vessels in the Halten/Nordland area. “The standby vessel is the final stage in the work of establishing an emergency response plan for the Halten/Nordland area. The ship represents a new type of vessel with features we haven’t seen before,” reports Steinar Solvang, responsible for health, safety and the environment in Statoil's Halten/Nordland business cluster. The ship, which is planned to be operational on 1 July 2003, will be able to accommodate up to 370 people in the event of a major incident. With the aid of a newly developed stern, the vessel will be able to pick up freefall lifeboats and man overboard (MOB) boats. It will therefore be capable of operating MOB boats in extreme weather conditions. The vessel will be equipped with a helicopter pad; this will enable combined operations with the search and rescue (SAR) helicopter, which is also included in the emergency response plan for Halten/Nordland. The vessel will play a key role in oil spill preparedness. In addition to oil protection equipment, it will have a workshop for analysing oil discharges. There will also be technology on board that can be used with the helicopter to combat oil spills. The standby vessel will be around 90 metres long and 18 metres wide. It will be able to maintain a speed of 20 knots and will have a crew of 12. The ship will be built at Aker Aukra, in cooperation with Langsten, in western Norway.

Previous attempts to economically harvest energy from waves - which the World Energy Council reckons can eventually supply 15 percent of current world energy demand - have been crippled by cumbersome designs. Devices have been designed with enough steel to withstand storms, but will only extract energy from normal-size waves most of the time. Norsk Hydro Technology Ventures has acted as lead investor for a group that includes SAM Private Equity in Zurich and 3i, one of Europe\\'s leading venture capital groups. Together they are committing £6 million (EUR 9.8 million) in equal shares to Ocean Power Delivery with the aim of getting a working prototype in the water, producing electricity to the grid within two years. The EU commitment to sourcing 12.5 percent of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2010 has become a significant force for developing new technologies. Wind power has been at the forefront - with installed European capacity forecast to grow from 18,000 MW in 2000 to 58,000 MW by 2005. There are clear signs offshore wave energy will emulate these growth rates if devices can withstand harsh ocean conditions.

The group’s partners in the project are state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), with 38 per cent, and TotalFinaElf with 47 per cent. “We have particularly contributed to this development with planning and execution of drilling and well activities, field development planning, project execution and the main principles for marketing and sale of the upgraded crude oil,” explains Kåre Røsandhaug, Statoil's vice president for international production. It has taken 42 months to bring the upgrading plant into full operation. Sincor holds a contract with the Venezuelan authorities to produce the Zuata fields until 2037. Statoil has bought one of the first cargoes, which is due to leave Jose within the next few weeks.\",\n",
       " 'Reducing environmental impact New methods and systematic environmental work mean that harmful discharges to the sea from Statoil fields will be reduced dramatically in the years ahead. “Statoil has the same objective as the authorities – zero harmful discharges to the sea by 2005. New technology is the key to reaching this objective,” reports Henrik Carlsen, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. He points out that Statoil has carried out extensive work for many years in order to arrive at appropriate solutions to reduce harmful discharges to the sea. “We have developed a new system for calculating the precise environmental risk for each individual field,\" says Mr Carlsen. \"This enables us to set our priorities based on costs and effect on the environment. Each project can thereby choose those measures that provide the best environmental value for money.\" Snøhvit and Kristin represent a new generation of oil and gas fields, using efficient environmental solutions based on this method. The Snøhvit field will produce with zero harmful discharges to the sea. A closed industrial plant on land will clean the discharges before they are released to the sea. Statoil has also worked systematically in order to reduce the environmental strain caused by discharges to the sea by phasing out the use of environmentally harmful chemicals. Since 1997 the group has reduced annual discharges of harmful chemicals by over 80 per cent – from almost 2,000 tonnes to around 350 tonnes. “Today, 90 per cent of all chemicals we use are environmentally friendly,” says Mr Carlsen. He stresses that a clean sea is a precondition for Statoil’s operations. For more information see the presentation .

       " 'Ormen Lange landfall proposed Nyhamn in mid-Norway has been recommended by operator Norsk Hydro as a landfall site for gas from the Ormen Lange field in the Norwegian Sea today, 14 March. This assumes that a landfall in Norway is chosen. Hydro has made it clear that a big gap still exists between the cost of such a solution and direct pipeline export to continental Europe. The operator has carried out extensive studies of the landfall issue within a tight schedule. With 11 per cent of the licence, Statoil regards it as important that thorough efforts are devoted to a possible domestic landfall for Ormen Lange gas and potential other finds in the same area. Before a final decision is taken on landing these resources, all coordination gains from bringing the gas ashore at the group’s Tjeldbergodden site in mid-Norway must be clarified. Statoil takes the view that such benefits remain inadequately explored, and intends to propose to the licence that further studies of Tjeldbergodden are pursued in parallel with work on Nyhamn. This could provide a more robust basis for deciding between landfalls in Norway or continental Europe. Statoil believes that the Ormen Lange licence should reconsider Tjeldbergodden, already the landfall for the Haltenpipe line from Heidrun, should this option prove competitive with Nyhamn. Since extensive impact assessments have already been done for Tjeldbergodden, Statoil believes that the licence will be able to carry out the required assessements within the operator’s timetable.

       " \"Possible landing site chosen for the Ormen Lange gas If the future Ormen Lange gas field's production is to be transported directly to a nearby onshore facility, Nyhamn in Aukra municipality is deemed the most suitable landing site. To date, an offshore processing platform with direct gas export to market is the preferred solution. Nyhamn will be fully evaluated against the preferred offshore development by late 2002. The Nyhamn landing site will be further developed as part of the onshore development concept for bringing the gas ashore. It will be evaluated against a complete offshore concept with direct export of gas to the European market. Relative to a complete offshore scenario, the onshore alternative produces a significant capital gap. For the time being, the offshore concept seems NOK 5-8 billion less expensive than an onshore development. Updated estimates based on updated concept information will be developed towards concept selection in late 2002. Ormen Lange is the largest gas field under development on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The field is located 100 km off the coast of Møre, and possesses an estimated 400 billion m3 (bcm) gas reserves. The annual production rate is set at between 15-20 bcm per year, a magnitude of energy equivalent to cover all Norway's current demand. Production start for Ormen Lange is set for October 2007. Application accompanied by a Plan for Development and Operation (PDO) will be delivered to the authorities in December 2003. The Project is now in the concept selection phase where two key concepts are investigated: A full processing platform with direct gas export to the market Production facility at sea in combination with an onshore facility for processing and gas export to the market A full processing platform with direct gas export to the market Production facility at sea in combination with an onshore facility for processing and gas export to the market The decision whether to develop Ormen Lange as an offshore platform, or in combination with an onshore facility, is to be taken in December 2002. The identification of Nyhamn as the possible landing site is based on extensive analyses that have been in progress since spring 2000. Close cooperation was established between the Ormen Lange Project, municipalities involved and Møre and Romsdal County regarding the analysis processes and the site selection criteria. In addition to the evaluation of the economic aspects, the work is based on impact assessment studies within the areas of macro/socio economic interests, health, safety and environment, all performed by independent and leading consultant companies within each of the competence areas. Nyhamn is primarily being evaluated to cover the processing needs for a stand-alone Ormen Lange Development, but also assessed regarding the possibilities of becoming a future hub for other fields. During planning/pre-engineering of processing equipment and integration synergies as the basis for investment estimates, two different processing layout concepts have been considered for part of the Tjeldbergodden processing plant. Regarding these assessments, now after the selection of the possible site, it still remains to verify identified savings from synergy effects. The review work will be completed by May 1, 2002. The focus for further evaluations is to optimize both the offshore and onshore concepts, with the goal of identifying the key differences regarding value creation, costs, social considerations, health, safety and environment.

       " 'Qualifying Snøhvit link Work has begun at operator Statoil on qualifying technology for the record-long umbilical which will link its Snøhvit development in the Barents Sea with the land facilities in northern Norway. “We expect to sign a contract this summer for the subsea system and umbilical,” reports staff engineer Inge Polden in the Snøhvit project. “This job will be awarded to one of three suppliers we have frame agreements with.” Statoil and the subsea system suppliers are now testing existing technology for the 160-kilometre bundle of control lines and cables. This verification will continue until the end of 2002. All the wells planned for Snøhvit – 21 for gas and condensate and one for carbon dioxide injection – will be remotely controlled from land through the umbilical. The distance involved requires a voltage of 3,000 volts – three times the conventional level for a subsea facility. With a diameter of roughly 11 centimetres, the umbilical will contain high-voltage power lines, fibre-optic cables and hydraulic piping. The fibre-optic cables will be used to transmit control signals to subsea valves and to return information from sensors mounted in the wells. Snøhvit will involve the world’s longest distance between the control station on land and the first subsea installation on the field. By comparison, the maximum umbilical length on Statoil’s Åsgard field in the Norwegian Sea is 50 kilometres. And the group’s nearby Mikkel project will involve a span of 87 kilometres. Plans call for gas deliveries from Snøhvit to start in 2006. Snøhvit will be developed in three phases.

       " 'Snøhvit approved The plan for development and operation (PDO) of Statoil’s Snøhvit field in the Barents Sea was approved today, 7 March, by the Norwegian Storting (parliament). A green light was also given by legislators to the plan for installation and operation (PIO) of the associated land-based gas liquefaction plant at Melkøya near Hammerfest in northern Norway. \"We are very pleased that this development has received the go-ahead,” says Henrik Carlsen, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. “Producing these reserves will generate substantial revenues for us in the longer term. And this approval means a further increase in our booked reserves.” The Snøhvit gas and condensate field represents the first offshore development in the Barents Sea, and the first project in Europe based on gas liquefaction. Producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) opens a new and forward-looking commercial opportunity for Statoil, and will supplement its existing gas expertise. The project will have substantial economic spin-offs in northern Norway. It includes a subsea development tied back by pipeline to the receiving terminal and liquefaction plant at Melkøya. LNG will be exported in specialised ships to terminals in the USA and southern Europe. The development is costed at NOK 40 billion, excluding the LNG carriers. Plans call for work to begin in the near future, with production starting in 2006 and lasting until about 2030. Jobs at Melkøya in the construction phase are expected to total up to 1,200 work-years. Operation of the land-based facilities will require some 180 permanent employees drawn from the local area. Statoil and its partners in the Snøhvit field will now assess whether any of the conditions in the Storting’s approval need to be clarified before they take a final decision on development.

       " 'Prized bacteria The Norne licence in the Norwegian Sea and Statoil specialist Egil Sunde have jointly won the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate’s improved oil recovery (IOR) prize for 2001 today, 7 March. Mr Sunde is honoured for his development of the microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) method for extracting more of the stock tank oil originally in place (Stooip) in a reservoir. This solution utilises bacterial processes to help “wash” oil out of the pore system in the reservoir rock more effectively than with water injection alone. “Hopefully, the NPD award will help to increase awareness of the method and the opportunities which it offers,” Mr Sunde comments. He has played a leading role in research on various applications for microbes over the past 10 years. His work on MEOR embraces both laboratory tests and field trials in Austria. These efforts have demonstrated what happens in the reservoir when the bacteria are provided with nutrients, and what effect the system could have. The Norne licence shares the prize with him because the method is being adopted on this Statoil-operated field. According the NPD, it wants to honour Statoil for showing courage, being innovatory, daring to accept a little risk and taking the decision to implement the method offshore. “This is encouraging,” says Ole Magnar Drønen, petroleum technology manager for Norne. “We’re confident that the method will help to improve recovery from the field, perhaps by almost 30 million barrels over its producing life.” Statoil has long been a leader in IOR efforts on the Norwegian continental shelf.

       " 'Norne outshines The Statoil operated Norne field in the Norwegian Sea has set a production record of over 236,000 barrels of oil per day. The field is currently Statoil’s largest single producer on the Norwegian continental shelf. At today’s oil price of about NOK 175 (USD 19.8) per barrel, the daily output has a value of around NOK 42 million. On good days the field produces around 15,600 barrels above the design capacity of the production ship. Hans Eidissen, vice president for operations at Norne, says that the increase in production is partly due to the removal of bottlenecks in the production facilities and in the production wells, such as large pressure drops at the valves. This has helped to increase the oil flow. He also mentions the good regularity at the facilities. The field is currently producing from nine wells. There are two wells in particular that produce large volumes – up to 50,000 barrels per day each. The Norne field, which came on stream in November 1997, has reached plateau production.

       " \"Encouraging result for 2001 (vedlegg) Statoil (OSE: STL, NYSE: STO) achieved a good result in 2001. Income before tax for 2001 totalled NOK 56.2 billion (USD 6.2 billion) as against NOK 60 billion (USD 6.8 billion) the year before. Net income came to NOK 17.2 billion (USD 1.9 billion), an increase of NOK 1.1 billion (USD 121 million) from 2000. The return on capital employed after tax amounted to 19.9 per cent (17.6 per cent after adjusting for special items) for 2001, as against 18.7 per cent the year before. Financial statements and review - fourth quarter 2001 Presentation set PDF-version (3,4 Mb) Oil and gas production averaged 1 007 000 barrels of oil equivalents (boe) per day in 2001, as against 1 003 000 the year before. The daily average in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 1 091 000 boe. New fields on stream and high gas sales were the main reasons for the high level of production in this period. The Statoil board has recommended to the annual general meeting that a dividend of NOK 2.85 (USD 0.32) per share be paid for 2001. “These results are encouraging given that our markets have been substantially weaker over the past year, with lower oil prices and narrower refining margins,” comments Statoil chief executive Olav Fjell. “They show that we again made substantial progress in 2001.” The group was substantially strengthened by the acquisition of assets from the state’s direct financial interest (SDFI) in Norwegian petroleum operations. Statoil's oil and gas reserves increased by 50 per cent. The successful stock market listing in June has given Statoil greater financial flexibility. The underlying profitability has been improved by meeting the target of reducing costs by NOK 4 billion since the improvement programme was adopted in 1999, and by strengthening the group’s portfolio through a reduction of just over 20 per cent in capital employed up to 31 December. During 2001, Statoil sanctioned a number of major projects on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) and internationally. These will contribute to long-term growth and development. The group also concluded substantial new gas contracts, which strengthen its position in new and existing markets.

The group also concluded substantial new gas contracts, which strengthen its position in new and existing markets. An active 2001 – lower finding and development costs A number of new fields came on stream in 2001, including Glitne, Huldra, the Gullfaks satellites and Snorre North on the NCS and Girassol off Angola. Statoil is currently involved in 11 fields under development off Norway and internationally. Finding and development costs for the group came to USD 4.6 per boe in 2001, as against USD 11.8 the year before. Production costs per boe declined from USD 3.1 in 2000 to USD 2.9. Statoil’s proven oil and gas reserves totalled 4 277 million boe at 31 December 2001. This represents a decline of 40 million boe over the year. At 89 per cent, the reserve replacement rate for 2001 was influenced by the sale of assets on the NCS and in Vietnam. Adjusted for these disposals, reserve replacement came to 112 per cent. “We’re prioritising efforts to improve our reserve replacement rate by maturing proven discoveries and by increasing our commitment to exploration,” says Mr Fjell. Activity was also high in the gas sector. Statoil concluded new sales contracts in the UK, Poland, the USA and Spain during 2001, and began deliveries to Italy. A marketing company was established in Turkey together with KOC. “We occupy a strong position in an expanding European gas market, and we’ll be continuing to exploit that in coming years,” observes Mr Fjell. “And the Snøhvit project in the Barents Sea means that we’ll also be a player in the global market for liquefied natural gas, which is growing fast as well.” Within manufacturing and marketing, oil trading in particular achieved a substantial improvement. Statoil traded an average of 2.2 million barrels of oil per day in 2001. This included its own production, crude sold on behalf of the state and trade with purchased oil. The group again achieved a satisfactory refining result in 2001, even though it was weakened somewhat by lower margins. Retailing yielded better results than 2000, thanks to a combination of better margins and reduced cost. At 31 December, Statoil had 21 new automated petrol stations in operation under its 1-2-3 brand. Development of the new station network will strengthen the group’s competitiveness and help it to maintain market share. Results from the methanol business were the best since the manufacturing plant at Tjeldbergodden became operational in 1997. Production was high and stable. Improved safety results Statoil stepped up its efforts during 2001 to prevent harm to people and the environment. After several years of stagnation, safety results improved substantially. However, two fatalities were suffered by contractors working for the Statoil group. Both have been thoroughly investigated, and measures which could help to prevent similar accidents adopted. The total recordable injury frequency, which measures injuries per million working hours, declined from 10.1 in 2000 to 6.7. This is the lowest level in Statoil’s history. Sickness absence remained low, and was further reduced from 3.5 per cent in 2000 to 3.4 per cent. An improvement was also seen for incidents with a high loss potential, from 4.3 to 4.1. “We will continue to keep a close eye on developments in the safety area,” says Mr Fjell. “Work to reinforce our safety culture and the role of managers is very important in that context. “We also place great emphasis on cooperation with other companies, the unions and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.” More about the results for 2001 Income before financial items came to NOK 56.2 billion. Adjusted for special items, this figure amounted to NOK 53.9 billion as against NOK 60 billion in 2000. This represents a decline of six per cent, which primarily reflects lower oil prices and narrower refining margins. These effects were offset to some extent by an increase in gas prices, higher oil sales and sales gains. Adjusted for special items relating to the sale and write-down of assets, net income came to NOK 15.2 billion as against NOK 16.2 billion in 2000. The return on capital employed in 2001 was 17.6 per cent, compared with 18.7 per cent in 2000 after adjusting for special items. Tax expenses for 2001 totalled NOK 38.5 billion as against NOK 40.5 million the year before. The price of Brent Blend reference crude fell by 14 per cent during 2001, from USD 28.5 (NOK 251) per barrel to USD 24.4 (NOK 220). Gas prices averaged NOK 1.22 per cubic metre, compared with NOK 0.99 the year before. Investments totalled NOK 17.4 billion. The group’s debt-equity ratio came to 39 per cent, and is regarded as satisfactory. Business area results for the fourth quarter Income before financial items for Exploration & Production Norway in the fourth quarter came to NOK 6.9 billion, compared with NOK 14.1 billion for the same period of 2000. This decline primarily reflects lower oil prices, higher exploration costs and increased depreciation as a result of higher production and new fields on stream. These effects have been partially offset by increased lifting of oil and higher gas prices, as well as reduced operating costs. Adjusted for special items, International Exploration & Production recorded a loss of NOK 502 million before financial items for the fourth quarter. That compares with a loss of NOK 205 million in the same period of 2000. Income before financial items for Natural Gas in the fourth quarter totalled NOK 2.5 billion, as against NOK 3.1 billion for the same period of 2000. This decline mainly reflects lower gas prices and a reduced contribution from Statpipe because Statoil’s equity interest in this North Sea transport system was reduced. Income before financial items for Manufacturing & Marketing in the fourth quarter came to NOK 1.2 billion, compared with NOK 1.4 billion in the same period of 2000. This result was influenced by weak refinery margins and some decline in earnings at the Navion shipping subsidiary. Oil trading did better than in 4th quarter 2000, while results for retailing were on a par with the same period of last year. For further information on results, see www.statoil.com Consolidated balance sheet (USGAAP) – unaudited Statoil (OSE: STL, NYSE: STO) achieved a good result in 2001. Income before tax for 2001 totalled NOK 56.2 billion (USD 6.2 billion) as against NOK 60 billion (USD 6.8 billion) the year before. Net income came to NOK 17.2 billion (USD 1.9 billion), an increase of NOK 1.1 billion (USD 121 million) from 2000. The return on capital employed after tax amounted to 19.9 per cent (17.6 per cent after adjusting for special items) for 2001, as against 18.7 per cent the year before. Financial statements and review - fourth quarter 2001 Presentation set PDF-version (3,4 Mb) Oil and gas production averaged 1 007 000 barrels of oil equivalents (boe) per day in 2001, as against 1 003 000 the year before. The daily average in the fourth quarter of 2001 was 1 091 000 boe. New fields on stream and high gas sales were the main reasons for the high level of production in this period. The Statoil board has recommended to the annual general meeting that a dividend of NOK 2.85 (USD 0.32) per share be paid for 2001. “These results are encouraging given that our markets have been substantially weaker over the past year, with lower oil prices and narrower refining margins,” comments Statoil chief executive Olav Fjell. “They show that we again made substantial progress in 2001.” The group was substantially strengthened by the acquisition of assets from the state’s direct financial interest (SDFI) in Norwegian petroleum operations. Statoil's oil and gas reserves increased by 50 per cent. The successful stock market listing in June has given Statoil greater financial flexibility. The underlying profitability has been improved by meeting the target of reducing costs by NOK 4 billion since the improvement programme was adopted in 1999, and by strengthening the group’s portfolio through a reduction of just over 20 per cent in capital employed up to 31 December. During 2001, Statoil sanctioned a number of major projects on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) and internationally. These will contribute to long-term growth and development. The group also concluded substantial new gas contracts, which strengthen its position in new and existing markets.

The group also concluded substantial new gas contracts, which strengthen its position in new and existing markets. An active 2001 – lower finding and development costs A number of new fields came on stream in 2001, including Glitne, Huldra, the Gullfaks satellites and Snorre North on the NCS and Girassol off Angola. Statoil is currently involved in 11 fields under development off Norway and internationally. Finding and development costs for the group came to USD 4.6 per boe in 2001, as against USD 11.8 the year before. Production costs per boe declined from USD 3.1 in 2000 to USD 2.9. Statoil’s proven oil and gas reserves totalled 4 277 million boe at 31 December 2001. This represents a decline of 40 million boe over the year. At 89 per cent, the reserve replacement rate for 2001 was influenced by the sale of assets on the NCS and in Vietnam. Adjusted for these disposals, reserve replacement came to 112 per cent. “We’re prioritising efforts to improve our reserve replacement rate by maturing proven discoveries and by increasing our commitment to exploration,” says Mr Fjell. Activity was also high in the gas sector. Statoil concluded new sales contracts in the UK, Poland, the USA and Spain during 2001, and began deliveries to Italy. A marketing company was established in Turkey together with KOC. “We occupy a strong position in an expanding European gas market, and we’ll be continuing to exploit that in coming years,” observes Mr Fjell. “And the Snøhvit project in the Barents Sea means that we’ll also be a player in the global market for liquefied natural gas, which is growing fast as well.” Within manufacturing and marketing, oil trading in particular achieved a substantial improvement. Statoil traded an average of 2.2 million barrels of oil per day in 2001. This included its own production, crude sold on behalf of the state and trade with purchased oil. The group again achieved a satisfactory refining result in 2001, even though it was weakened somewhat by lower margins. Retailing yielded better results than 2000, thanks to a combination of better margins and reduced cost. At 31 December, Statoil had 21 new automated petrol stations in operation under its 1-2-3 brand. Development of the new station network will strengthen the group’s competitiveness and help it to maintain market share. Results from the methanol business were the best since the manufacturing plant at Tjeldbergodden became operational in 1997. Production was high and stable. Improved safety results Statoil stepped up its efforts during 2001 to prevent harm to people and the environment. After several years of stagnation, safety results improved substantially. However, two fatalities were suffered by contractors working for the Statoil group. Both have been thoroughly investigated, and measures which could help to prevent similar accidents adopted. The total recordable injury frequency, which measures injuries per million working hours, declined from 10.1 in 2000 to 6.7. This is the lowest level in Statoil’s history. Sickness absence remained low, and was further reduced from 3.5 per cent in 2000 to 3.4 per cent. An improvement was also seen for incidents with a high loss potential, from 4.3 to 4.1. “We will continue to keep a close eye on developments in the safety area,” says Mr Fjell. “Work to reinforce our safety culture and the role of managers is very important in that context. “We also place great emphasis on cooperation with other companies, the unions and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.” More about the results for 2001 Income before financial items came to NOK 56.2 billion. Adjusted for special items, this figure amounted to NOK 53.9 billion as against NOK 60 billion in 2000.

       " 'Restructuring for new challenges Hydro Aluminium is retooling into a lean, more cost-efficient business to handle tighter markets and the integration with two major companies. The year 2001 was not kind to Hydro Aluminium, says Jon-Harald Nilsen, executive vice president for the business area. Markets for aluminium - especially in automotive and other extrusion applications - were weak last year. The US market was hardest hit. Aluminium consumption in the Western world shrank 6 percent, the largest single annual decline in 20 years. Hydro\\'s magnesium business didn\\'t escape, either. Growing exports from China have put tremendous pressure on prices, contributing to the closure of Hydro\\'s magnesium plant in Porsgrunn, Norway. \"We had to look at our cost levels and competitive position,\" Nilsen says. The result was the Light Metals Organization project, which redrew the lines between business sectors. The reorganization led to both internal gains and market benefits. \"We had to reduce costs in sales, administration and support and simplify the organization. It was also in preparation for the integration with VAW and Technal. \"But the gathering of activities under Automotive and North America will make us a stronger and better partner with our customers in the various business sectors,\" Nilsen says. With the integration of the German company VAW, Hydro Aluminium will become one of the leading suppliers of rolled products in the world and will be one of the largest automotive suppliers. In addition, the new Hydro Aluminium will rank no. 3 in the US extrusion industry and will maintain its leading extrusion position in Europe. This year, the market will continue to challenge Hydro Aluminium in the first half, Nilsen explains, but the second half is expected to bring better times.

       " 'Hydro stronger, but results need to improve Important strategic steps have been taken to strengthen Hydro, but the economic results are not good enough. This is how Eivind Reiten sums up his first annual result as chief executive. \"Even though we didn\\'t reach the same record level that we did in 2000, we mustn\\'t forget that our substantial efforts in 2001 have brought about one of the best results in the company\\'s history, despite difficult market conditions for important products. However, we cannot be satisfied. We still have work to do before we can offer a good enough return on the company\\'s total capital,\" Reiten says. Net income of NOK 7.9 billion is NOK 6 billion lower than in 2000. Weaker aluminium markets and the fact that oil prices were significantly lower explain a lot. But not everything. Room for more \"In 2001 we made preparations for the acquisition of VAW aluminium AG, one of Hydro\\'s most important strategic steps ever. Our aluminium operation is now number one in Europe and will be a key global player. Agri is clearly the global leader in this sector through its successful turnaround operation. Oil and Energy has created a good starting point for increased production and has acquired very interesting positions outside Norway. Altogether, we are stronger than ever within each of our business areas,\" Reiten points out. His message for 2002 is clear: There is a need for, and room for, improvement. More can be done - lots more. But improvements have to happen fast. The improvements he aims to achieve are already set in motion, some which are related to the announced improvements in Aluminium, where integration of the newly acquired German aluminium company VAW is a central factor. \"Delivery according to plan is not the only key to creating the results we want in the future. We also have to demonstrate the organization\\'s ability to bring about major changes in a relatively short time,\" he says. Strong will According to Reiten, the successful turnaround in Hydro Agri illustrates the company\\'s ability to get the job done. In addition to changing this business area from a problem child to an exciting and promising focus area, Agri Turnaround has demonstrated the organization\\'s great potential in a new and convincing way. \"I\\'m impressed by the ability to change Agri has shown. At the same time, we\\'ll demonstrate that the ability to change is no less in our other business areas. Hydro Aluminium is currently in the middle of an ambitious change process, which in many ways has been inspired by the achievements in Agri. The acquisition and integration of VAW provides an extra jolt for the reorganization that was already underway, but it also brings some additional challenges. During the course of the coming year we will concentrate our efforts and reduce costs by a total of NOK 1.6 billion,\" he says. Reiten points out that he has given top priority in 2002 to ensuring that the integration and change process is successful and the economic synergies intrinsic in the acquisition are realized. Bringing debt down At the end of 2001, Hydro had considerable cash reserves and a very strong financial position, which made the acquisition of VAW possible. \"It\\'s important that we bear in mind that our gearing ratio after the purchase of VAW will increase to give a long-term debt/equity ratio of around 0.7. One of our key targets is to bring the debt/equity ratio back to 0.5, which is our target level. Stringent capital discipline in all areas of the company is therefore imperative. We will also direct sharp focus to disposal of operations that are outside of our core areas - Hydro Petrochemicals, the Danish feed and agriculture company KFK and VAW Flexible Packaging. International expectations Although the challenges and opportunities facing the Aluminium area are great, there are equally high expectations for Oil and Energy. Oil production started, albeit somewhat delayed, in new fields off Angola and Canada just before and just after the end of the year respectively. This increases Hydro\\'s international oil production considerably, and in the fourth quarter the company\\'s total production from both Norwegian and international fields amounted to 451,000 barrels of oil equivalents a day. Meanwhile more reserves were added during 2001 than the company produced, giving a reserve replacement of 122 percent. \"In the international arena 2002 was, without parallel, our most exciting exploration year so far. The next months\\' charting, which will clarify whether the potential we hope for and believe in really is there, is more than just interesting seismics.

Safety high priority Several tasks stand out in the oil arena at home: \"One is to continue the work on improving operations on the fields for which we are operator. Although this is sometimes overshadowed by other tasks in our communication activities, it is absolutely fundamental as it is the source of so much of our cash flow.

       " 'Agri better poised to meet market head on Global market conditions for fertilizers were \"pretty good\" last year, says Thorleif Enger, executive vice president responsible for the Agri business. Prices in some of Hydro Agri\\'s markets remained relatively weaker than the average of a normal business cycle , but the organization is stronger as a result of its Turnaround program to cut costs. Hydro produces the key input for fertilizer manufacture - ammonia - both for its own consumption and for external sales. In the United States, prices for natural gas used to make ammonia started off high in early 2001 but declined during the year, weakening ammonia prices along the way. Hydro sells much of its ammonia production from Trinidad, while the production consumption equation is nearly balanced in Europe. \"In Europe,\" - Hydro\\'s core market for fertilizers - \"prices for our main products continued the positive trend that started in 2000,\" Enger says. A key influence on fertilizer prices in Europe is external imports of products from the former Soviet Union countries. In the 2000-2001 season, these imports jumped 30 percent. In the first half of the 2001-2002 season, however, imports are down by almost 20 percent. Looking ahead to the next two to three years, Enger sees positive trends in international markets. \"Still, we can expect global market growth of 2 to 3 percent. And following the Turnaround program, Agri is better poised than many of its competitors to meet these market conditions,\" Enger says. \"We will grow more than the market by increasing our market share. That growth will be strong in emerging markets and in high-margin areas. \"The Turnaround program is another reason why we can expect to grow. Our organization is poised to take advantage of the consolidation that\\'s expected in the next years in the industry. \"Our competitors aren\\'t standing still, but the rate of improvement for Hydro has been better.

A key influence on fertilizer prices in Europe is external imports of products from the former Soviet Union countries. In the 2000-2001 season, these imports jumped 30 percent. In the first half of the 2001-2002 season, however, imports are down by almost 20 percent. Looking ahead to the next two to three years, Enger sees positive trends in international markets. \"Still, we can expect global market growth of 2 to 3 percent. And following the Turnaround program, Agri is better poised than many of its competitors to meet these market conditions,\" Enger says. \"We will grow more than the market by increasing our market share. That growth will be strong in emerging markets and in high-margin areas. \"The Turnaround program is another reason why we can expect to grow. Our organization is poised to take advantage of the consolidation that\\'s expected in the next years in the industry. \"Our competitors aren\\'t standing still, but the rate of improvement for Hydro has been better.',\n",
       " 'Gas-fired power postponed The board of Norway’s Naturkraft company has resolved to ask the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy to extend its licence for building two gas-fired power stations in western Norway. One reason for this application is that it will allow the units at Kårstø north of Stavanger and Kollsnes near Bergen to be integrated in other installations planned at these sites. That will improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions and improve project economics, says Gunnar Myrvang. He is one of Statoil’s two directors in Naturkraft, which is owned one-third each by the group, Norsk Hydro and state power company Statkraft. At Kårstø, Naturkraft wants to study whether its planned power station can be coordinated with receiving facilities due to be built for gas from Kristin and Mikkel in the Norwegian Sea. And plans at Kollsnes call for new compressors to be installed in connection with gas exports. Mr Myrvang also says that Naturkraft needs more time to develop a project which is good enough in terms of the profitability requirements set by its owners. As a result, the company will be unable to complete the gas-fired power stations before its present licence expires in 2004. This permit is based on today’s technology. “We’ve noted that the government wants to develop ‘carbon-dioxide-free’ gas-fired power stations,” says Mr Myrvang. “But we need a clarification of the government’s contribution before deciding on this.” He expects that the stations can be operational two-three years after an investment decision has been taken.

A letter of intent has also been signed with the Veidekke and Selmer Skanska companies to construct a road and a 2.3 km subsea tunnel from Hammerfest to Melkøya. The contracts have a combined value of around NOK 700 million. “This is one of the largest construction contracts on land in Scandinavia,” reports Morten Vinje, area manager in the Snøhvit organisation. Most of the investments are related to the blasting and levelling of the industrial site. The work includes the construction of cooling water tunnels, a dock for the process plant and a quay. Mr Vinje adds that the contracts are being awarded with the proviso that the Storting (parliament) approves the Snøhvit development, which will probably take place in March. He says that the purpose of awarding the contracts so early is to give the contractors time to plan the work and establish subcontractors. Plans call for the work to begin immediately following the Storting’s ruling. The levelling of the site is estimated to take one year. It will then be ready for the installation of process facilities and the four storage tanks – two for liquefied natural gas (LNG), one for liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) and one for condensate.

       " 'Investing in sulphur fund An environmental fund has been established by Norway’s process industry, including Statoil, to reduce Norwegian emissions of sulphur. Instead of paying a green tax of NOK 3.09 per kilogram of sulphur emitted, process industry companies began contributing an equivalent amount to the fund from 1 January. The aim is to cut annual sulphur emissions from participants by at least 5,000 tonnes in 2010. Norway is thereby moving from passive environmental taxes to a system which gives industries collective responsibility for spending the same money on effective anti-pollution measures. No other country in Europe has adopted this approach at present, claims Terje Palmesen, health, safety and the environment manager at the Mongstad refinery operated by Statoil near Bergen. The board of the fund will make grants to help build desulphurisation plants in the Norwegian process industry. Some 1,000 tonnes of sulphur are emitted annually from Mongstad every year, for instance – 50-60 per cent of the amount allowed in its operating permit. “By devoting cash from the fund to new environmental measures, we hope to cut emissions even further – even though we’re already among the best in the business in this area,” says Mr Palmesen. Getting companies to emit less sulphur will help Norway to meet its obligations under the Gothenburg protocol on acidification, excessive use of fertiliser and ground-level ozone.

The method – subsea logging – complements seismic logging, which is based on sound waves. This week saw the foundation of Electromagnetic GeoServices (EMGS). Statoil holds the majority interest in the company, which will sell services related to subsea logging. Statoil has already tested out the technology during the 17th licensing round on the Norwegian continental shelf. The results are promising and will be a big boost when the group prepares its application for new acreage in the Norwegian sector. “The technology makes it easier to identify hydrocarbons in deep water,” reports Terje Eidesmo, general manager of EMGS. In addition to the Norwegian continental shelf, it may also be appropriate for western Africa, the Gulf of Mexico and South America. Mr Eidesmo adds that the method can also be developed for use in shallow waters and for monitoring reservoirs. Research vice president Gunnar Myrebøe says that the formation of EMGS is a good example of how Statoil can commercialise results from technology. The technology was born at the group’s research centre in Trondheim and research will continue in this area. Statoil has sold the rights to its patented technology to EMGS.

Gas transport through the Oseberg Gas Transport (OGT) and Vesterled systems resumed operation Jan. 23 and were expected to reach normal operational levels Thursday evening. Normally, Heimdal receives between 10-13 million cubic meters of gas per day from the Oseberg Gas Transport system. It processes some 6-8 million cubic meters gas from Huldra and produces about 2 million cubic meters of gas from its own reservoir. Heimdal consists of an integrated steel platform and a new riser platform. It is a hub for processing and distributing gas in the North Sea. The gas center, which receives gas from both the OGT and Huldra field, will export gas to the Grane oil field starting in 2003. Production from the satellite field Vale is set to start producing this summer.

No oil or gas was found by a wildcat drilled in the summer of 2000 on this acreage, which lies 150 kilometres west of Nuuk, the Greenland capital. The results of the well prompted Statoil and the other licensees to notify the authorities that they did not wish to pursue further exploration in the licence. According to Greenland's Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum, the Phillips-operated Sisimiut licence further north has also been relinquished. Statoil was a partner in that acreage as well.

Due to be spread over three years, this donation was announced by chief executive Olav Fjell in an open lecture at the college today, 22 January. The gift is being made in connection with this year’s 30th anniversary of Statoil’s foundation and the emergence of Stavanger as an oil city. Representatives from the group and the college will be discussing how the money can best be applied to support the development of a university in Stavanger. In his lecture, Mr Fjell referred to the close and good collaboration which has existed between college and group. “Activities at the college interact with our industrial interests in a number of areas,” he noted. Specialist teams in reservoir analysis and drilling and well technology built up at the college and its affiliated Rogaland Research institute have given solid support to Statoil’s work off Norway. Mr Fjell also noted that the college has been an important source of well-educated staff. Over time, roughly 10 per cent of recruits to the Statoil parent company have taken their main studies there. A university in Stavanger could serve the group’s long-term need for expertise in an even better way than at present, said Mr Fjell. “It would create a stronger teaching and research community in our immediate vicinity, which is particularly interesting for us because much of our expertise will be at head office in Stavanger.” NOK 10 million is being given by Statoil to help the Stavanger University College (HiS) in its efforts to achieve full university status.

       " 'Tjeldbergodden going strong In 2001, record amounts of methanol, air gases and liquefied natural gas, (LNG) were produced at Statoil’s Tjeldbergodden industrial plant in mid-Norway. Production of LNG was increased threefold compared with the year before – from around 4000 tonnes to more than 12,000 tonnes. The main product methanol closed the year at 867,000 tonnes, whereas the figure for 2000 was 725,000 tonnes. The production of liquefied gases of the air increased from around 58,000 tonnes to just over 71,000 tonnes. Arve Rennemo, who is in charge of the industrial plant, says that modifications, optimisation of the process and two turnarounds in 2000 and 1998 have made it possible to utilise the facilities more efficiently. A stable supply of electricity and gas to the plant has also had a positive effect on the result. “But it is the people, not the systems, that do the work,” he says. In addition to the employees’ commitment and skills, the good regularity has provided a boost to the results for health, safety and the environment (HSE), adds Mr Rennemo. The land facility was awarded the chief executive’s HSE prize last year. The Tjeldbergodden plant commenced production of methanol in 1997.

Naturgass Grenland AS is owned 30 per cent each by Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Skagerak Energi, while Gasnor has a 10 per cent holding. The agreement creating the company was signed on behalf of Statoil by Gunnar Myrvang, vice president for gas and energy solutions. A preliminary study by the owners shows that natural gas can be profitably distributed in the coastal area around the towns of Skien and Porsgrunn south of Oslo. The next step will be to identify which companies in the region could convert to gas from heating oil, for instance. Mr Myrvang envisages annual sales of 20-30 million cubic metres. This compares with Gasnor’s existing turnover of 40 million cubic metres in the Haugaland region north of Stavanger. With its head office in Porsgrunn, Naturgass Grenland looks ahead to the possibility that a Norwegian gas trunkline – including a branch to Grenland – could be laid through the Skagerrak to Poland.

       " 'Supplying pipe for Kvitebjørn oil pipeline Corus Tubes steelworks will supply pipe for the Kvitebjørn oil pipeline, which will be laid between the Kvitebjørn gas and condensate field and Troll Oil Pipeline II in the North Sea. The contract, which is worth around NOK 100 million, includes the manufacture of 90 kilometres of 16 inch steel pipe. The order is for high frequency longitudinally welded pipe (HFW) – not seamless, which is usual for this dimension of pipe. Jostein Breivik, coordinator for the pipelines in the Kvitebjørn project, reports that pipe manufactured in this way has already been tested on the Norwegian continental shelf, but not by Statoil. The lengths of pipe are made by applying high frequency alternating current during the welding. Consequently, it is not necessary to use flux. This is a relatively new and efficient method of production, and as a result the project has reduced pipe costs by about 20 per cent. The contract for the installation of the oil pipeline will be entered into in May, reports Mr Breivik. The Kvitebjørn condensate will be transported in the Kvitebjørn oil pipeline via Troll Oil Pipeline II to the Statoil-operated Mongstad terminal near Bergen for storage and export. The rich gas will go through a separate pipeline to the Kollsnes plant, where fluids will be separated and sent for treatment at the Vestprosess plant at Mongstad.

Capital Markets Day - presentations, conference call Hydro Agri Turnaround was concluded at the year-end. The cost-saving and workforce reduction goals were met by a wide margin, with both elements reduced by 30 per cent compared to 1998 levels. The program speeded up productivity development and culminated in the previous growth in fixed costs per tonne being turned into a solid NOK 2.3 billion reduction compared to 1998. The manning reduction in the same period was 3,600 persons. The European fertilizer industry has reduced production capacity by three million tonnes over the last couple of years. Combined with the effect of a simplified organization, the new measures that have been implemented and a stronger position also outside of Europe, this gives Hydro Agri a new platform for continued creation of value. \"At the same time as we focus on production improvements, we are also trying to utilize the business opportunities that often arise at the bottom of the business cycle. We have purchased the fertilizer companies Trevo in Brazil and Kynoch in South Africa, and we have started an extensive market collaboration in the Philipines and with the Chilean specialty fertilizer company SQM. We have also given the go-ahead for the extension of production capacity through our partner company Qafco in the Persian Gulf. Enger underlines that Hydro is in the best quartile in the fertilizer industry in terms of cash return on gross investment (CROGI). \"The growth in the fertilizer market is not spectacular, but it is steady. We expect a two to three percent growth per year. Hydro is the only really global company in this industry. We have operations all over the world, and our production range of nutrients is a close match to the demand in the market.\" He also pointed out that the strategic links to the Danish animal feed and plant nutrition company KFK are looser than they were. Hydro therefore intends to reduce its present ownership interest of 62 percent in this company and will try to find a purchaser that has more to offer the company than Hydro has. \"The greatest threat facing the fertilizer industry is the risk of unnecessary capacity increases. The industry has previously shown a tendency to overinvest,\" says Thorleif Enger. \"More and more growth in the market will take place through agreements with third party producers,\" said executive vice president Thorleif Enger on Tuesday, Hydro\\'s Capital Markets Day. Following its successful turnaround operation, Hydro Agri is all set for \"asset-light growth\". Capital Markets Day - presentations, conference call Hydro Agri Turnaround was concluded at the year-end. The cost-saving and workforce reduction goals were met by a wide margin, with both elements reduced by 30 per cent compared to 1998 levels. The program speeded up productivity development and culminated in the previous growth in fixed costs per tonne being turned into a solid NOK 2.3 billion reduction compared to 1998. The manning reduction in the same period was 3,600 persons. The European fertilizer industry has reduced production capacity by three million tonnes over the last couple of years.

       " 'Record year for ports Shipping traffic at the four land facilities operated by Statoil in Norway and Denmark reached record levels in 2001. Almost 259 million barrels of crude were shipped from the Mongstad refinery near Bergen, reports port captain Jon Magne Jakobsen. This means that the facility receives, stores and exports more than a third of the oil produced annually by Statoil and the Norwegian state. Mongstad ranks as Europe’s second-largest oil port in terms of volume after Rotterdam. Traffic was also high at the Kårstø treatment complex north of Stavanger, with records set for both volume of products exported and the number of vessel calls. According to port manager Per Arne Nilsen, the facility had 600 calls in 2001 compared with 421 the year before. Roughly 4.5 million tonnes of normal butane, iso-butane, naphtha, propane and ethane were shipped out – an increase of 60 per cent from 2000. The 3.3 million tonnes of condensate (light oil) exported was roughly on a par with the year before. This rise in shipments partly reflects deliveries from Statoil’s Åsgard field in the Norwegian Sea and the start to ethane production at Kårstø. Almost 850,000 tonnes of methanol were exported from the Tjeldbergodden industrial complex in mid-Norway, an increase of 90,000 tonnes from the previous record in 1999. And 854 ship calls were logged by the refinery at Kalundborg near Copenhagen, up by 66 from 2000. No less than 708 of them related to exports of oil products.

Petrochemicals, VAW Flexible Packaging and Hydro\\'s 62 per cent stake in KFK, the Danish grain and feed company, are up for sale,\" announced executive vice president Leiv L. Nergaard on Capital Markets Day in Oslo on Tuesday. Nergaard stressed that Hydro\\'s main financial results target remains unchanged: a return on capital of minimum 10 per cent after tax on all investments (CROGI), a debt/equity ration of 0.5 and an average 30 per cent dividend for shareholders over the business cycle. \"The problem with a profitability goal of ten per cent is that we do not always know where we are in the business cycle for each of the areas. We therefore operate with normalized prices when measuring performance: an oil price of USD 18 per barrel, an LME 3 months aluminium price of USD 1500 per tonne, a CAN 27 fertilizer price of USD 113 dollar per tonne and a NOK/USD exchange rate of 8.00. In real terms we achieved a CROGI of 12.3 per cent in 2000, but given normalized prices this was just nine per cent. Our CROGI forecast for 2002 has been scaled down from ten to between eight and nine per cent. The downwards adjustment is due primarily to weaker market conditions for aluminium and investments for new growth in the Aluminium and Oil and Energy areas that have not yet come on stream.\" Nergaard pointed out that the average CROGI result for Oil and Energy during the past five years has exceeded ten per cent. This area has now entered a period of major international investments which do not generate immediate returns. Agri is much improved and in a position to achieve results of more than ten per cent in the coming years. Because of the VAW integration, and the Sunndal expansion, Aluminium will have to wait until 2004 before CROGI attains ten per cent. The divestment of activities outside the company\\'s core areas will make a positive contribution. \"The debt/equity ratio, which we have reduced considerably since the acquisition of Saga Petroleum, will now climb back 0.7 following our purchase of VAW. This is roughly the same level as it was at immediately after the Saga takeover. Our goal is to aim for 0.5 again in 2003, but this is conditional on our managing to divest operations for NOK 10 billion during the course of the next couple of years. We are continuing to sell off activities not defined as part of our core areas, and some divestments already concluded will be entered into the books in 2002. These include Pelican and some licenses from Oil and Energy, plus Oleochemicals from Agri.\" Nergaard stated that Hydro is planning to invest NOK 19 billion in 2002, with the VAW acquisition and a possible purchase of SDFI shares coming in addition.

       " 'Eivind Reiten: \"Flexible on structure, but not results\" \"Hydro\\'s strategic flexibility is strengthened by the Agri Turnaround and takeover of VAW. We must be flexible towards finding attractive solutions for the company\\'s structure, even if it means adjusting the current configuration,\" Hydro chief executive Eivind Reiten said today at the opening of the company\\'s Capital Markets Day in Oslo. Reiten also stressed that Hydro\\'s Oil and Gas business area has established interesting positions during the past year, not least internationally, and that the company\\'s financial capacity is strong. At the same time, he claimed harder work is needed to improve Hydro\\'s financial results. \"I\\'m not satisfied with our mode of achieving results. Higher levels of performance are needed if we\\'re going to reach an investment return goal (CROGI) of 10 percent during the business cycle. We will hardly reach the target of a normalized CROGI in 2002. Our plans indicate a level of between eight and nine percent. This clearly falls short of the goal. We have to muster renewed strength to improve our results and generate a more dynamic approach to managing the portfolio. \"The takeover of VAW establishes us as Europe\\'s leading aluminium company. From a strategic perspective, the two companies fit hands in gloves. The new company is well positioned as one of the largest integrated aluminium concerns in the world. In the short term, our goal is a successful merging of the two companies. We have the ambition to realize synergies and improvements in our original aluminium operations to the tune of NOK 1.6 billion (€201 million), and expect a total manning reduction of 1,100 employees. Reiten is very satisified with the Hydro Agri Turnaround process, which was wrapped up at the end of the year. The results are better than first expected. The turnaround has contributed to the the market balance for fertilizer in Europe is considerably better, fixed costs have been reduced by NOK 2.3 billion compared to 1998 and staffing has been reduced by 3,600. At the same time, market positions outside of Europe are stronger. The operation now has a good springboard for achieving sustainable results. Regarding Oil and Energy, Reiten notes that the production goal of 415,000 tons per day was achieved in 2001. Looking ahead, he sees annual growth of 5 to 6 percent through 2005, increased sales of natural gas and value growth through commercial activities. He characterizes the company\\'s exploration activities in the time ahead as exciting and notes that exploration and development costs are headed toward the company\\'s goal of $5 per barrel within 2003. He doesn\\'t hide the fact that he is not satisfied with Hydro\\'s share price trend of recent years. In addition to efforts to improve results, he says there will be a new program to sell off activities outside of the comany\\'s core business areas. \"Our goal is to sell operations outside the core for a total of NOK 10 billion by the end of 2003.
