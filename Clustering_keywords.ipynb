Organic capital expenditure* was USD 2.89 billion for the quarter, and total capital expenditures were USD 4.78 billion. After taxes, capital distribution to shareholders and investments, net cash flow* ended at negative USD 4.22 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted net debt to capital employed ratio* was negative 3.4% at the end of the second quarter, compared to negative 19.8% at the end of the first quarter of 2024. The calculation of net debt ratio includes the effect of the Norwegian state’s share of the share buy-back, at USD 4.02 billion paid in July. The board of directors has decided an ordinary cash dividend of USD 0.35 per share, and to continue the extraordinary cash dividend of USD 0.35 per share for the second quarter of 2024, in line with communication at the Capital Markets Update in February. Expected total capital distribution for 2024 is around USD 14 billion, including a share buy-back programme of up to USD 6 billion. The board has decided to initiate a third tranche of the share buy-back programme of up to USD 1.6 billion. The third tranche will commence on 25 July and end no later than 22 October 2024. The second tranche of the share buy-back programme for 2024 was completed on 19 July 2024 with a total value of USD 1.6 billion. All share buy-back amounts include shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State. *For items marked with an asterisk throughout this report, see Use and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in the Supplementary disclosures.

          "Equinor to commence third tranche of the 2024 share buy-back programme Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) will on 25 July 2024 commence the third tranche of up to USD 1.6 billion of the share buy-back programme for 2024, as announced in relation with the second quarter results 24 July 2024. In this third tranche of the share buy-back programme for 2024, shares for up to USD 528 million will be purchased in the market, implying a total third tranche of up to USD 1.6 billion including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State. The tranche will end no later than 22 October 2024. Equinor announced at the Capital Market Update in February 2024 a two-year share buy-back programme of total USD 10-12 billion for 2024-2025, with up to USD 6 billion for 2024, including shares to be redeemed from the Norwegian State. The share buy-back programme will be subject to market outlook and balance sheet strength and be structured into tranches where Equinor will buy back shares for a certain value in USD over a defined period. For the third tranche in 2024, Equinor will be entering into a non-discretionary agreement with a third party who will execute repurchases of shares and make its trading decisions independently of the company. Commencement of new share buy-back tranches after the third tranche in 2024 will be decided by the board of directors on a quarterly basis in line with the company’s dividend policy and will be subject to board authorisation for share buy-back from the company’s annual general meeting and agreement with the Norwegian State regarding share buy-back (as further described below). The purpose of the share buy-back programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the company. All shares purchased as part of the third tranche for 2024 will thus be cancelled through a capital reduction at the annual general meeting of the company in May 2025. Further information about the share buy-back programme and the third tranche: The third tranche of the share buy-back programme for 2024 is based on an authorisation granted to the board of directors at the annual general meeting of the company held on 14 May 2024. According to the authorisation, the maximum number of shares to be purchased in the market is 92 million, of which 73,194,421 remain available per commencement of the third tranche in 2024 (buy-backs made under previous tranches in the authorisation period taken into account). The minimum price that can be paid per share is NOK 50, and the maximum price is NOK 1,000. The authorisation is valid until the earliest of 30 June 2025 and the annual general meeting of the company in 2025. An agreement between Equinor",
          "and the Norwegian State regulates the State’s participation in the share buy-back: at the annual general meeting of the company in May 2025, the State will, as per proposal by the board of directors, vote for the cancellation of shares purchased in the market pursuant to the board authorisation, and the redemption and cancellation of a proportionate number of its shares in order to maintain its ownership share in the company at 67%. The price to be paid to the State for redemption of the State’s shares shall be the volume-weighted average of the price paid by Equinor for shares purchased in the market plus an interest rate compensation, adjusted for any dividends paid. In the third tranche in 2024, shares will be purchased on the Oslo Stock Exchange and possibly other trading venues within the EEA. Transactions will be conducted in accordance with applicable safe harbour conditions, and as further set out in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act of 2007, EU Commission Regulation (EC) No 2016/1052 and the Oslo Stock Exchange's Guidelines for buy-back programmes and price stabilisation from February 2021. The board of directors will propose to the annual general meeting to be held in May 2025, to cancel shares purchased in the market in this third tranche in 2024 and to redeem and cancel a proportionate number of the State’s shares per the agreement with the State. Based on renewal of this agreement, shares purchased under subsequent tranches of the share buy-back programme for 2024 and 2025 and a proportionate number of the State’s shares will follow a similar process at the annual general meetings of the company in 2025 and 2026, respectively.

The partnership submitted the plan for development and operation (PDO) of the Lavrans and Kristin Q discoveries as satellites to the Kristin field in 2021. This is the first phase of the Kristin South project. The PDO was approved by the authorities in 2022. “The Kristin South project demonstrates our strategy to create value by developing existing infrastructure on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Together with our partners and suppliers, we have developed the project and started the production from Lavrans in a safe and good way,” says Trond Bokn, senior vice president for project development in Equinor. A new subsea template has been installed and tied into the Kristin platform, now processing oil and gas from the first well at the Lavrans field. The gas will be exported through the pipeline system to the European market, while the oil will be transported to the market by ship via the Åsgard C storage vessel. Four additional wells are planned as part of the first phase of the Kristin South project, three at the Lavrans field and one in the Q-segment at the Kristin field. The latter will be drilled from an existing subsea template that has been tied back to the Kristin SEMI. The expected production in phase one of the Kristin South project is in the PDO estimated at 6.2 GSm3 of gas and 1.9 MSm3 of oil (a total of 58.2 million barrels of oil equivalent). “This is a key milestone in our plan to continue to develop new resources in a mature area in the Norwegian Sea. Tying in additional resources to our producing hubs is a cost-efficient way to add production and extend the lifespan of our fields in operation. This approach contributes to energy security and job creation in Norway,” says Grete B. Haaland, senior vice president for Exploration & Production North. The CO 2 intensity for extraction and production of Kristin South phase 1 is very low - less than 1 kg of CO 2 per barrel of oil equivalent. The emissions will mainly be generated from the project’s drilling activities. Norwegian suppliers have been awarded over 60% of",
          "the contract values in the development phase creating ripple effects along the coast. The project is estimated to have created 4,000 person-years across Norway, with 800 in the Mid-Norway region, over the 2020-2025 period. Lavrans was discovered in 1995, while the Kristin field was put on stream in 2005. The technical lifetime of the Kristin platform is currently estimated to be 2043 with potential for further extensions.

Equinor is Technical Service Provider Equinor and the Troll partners have decided to invest just over NOK 12 billion to further develop the gas infrastructure in the Troll West gas province. This will accelerate production from the reservoir and thus maintain the current high gas export levels from the Troll and Kollsnes value chain leading up to 2030. Stage 2 of the Troll Phase 3 project includes eight new wells from two new templates with subsea controls extended from existing templates. A new gas flowline will be laid as a tie-back to the Troll A platform, and the project will also perform modification work on Troll A.The first wells are scheduled to come on stream at the end of 2026. \"This is a highly profitable project that will secure high gas production from the Troll field. The partnership's decision is important in order for us to fully utilise the capacity of existing infrastructure. We've chosen to use solid, familiar suppliers, most of which already have framework agreements with us,\" says Geir Tungesvik, Equinor's executive vice president, Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP). \"It's a clear advantage that several of them have experience from the previous stage of the Troll Phase 3 development. We will build on this to achieve safe and efficient deliveries and implementation,\" Tungesvik says. The new infrastructure will accelerate production from the reservoir equivalent to about 55 billion standard cubic metres of gas. At its peak, the annual contribution from the new development will amount to around 7 billion standard cubic metres of gas. \"We have been working alongside our partners, Gassco and the Norwegian authorities to maximise energy deliveries from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) since 2022. This project will allow Troll",
          "and Kollsnes to continue their substantial contributions to the role of the NCS in guaranteeing European energy security in challenging times. The gas from Troll alone meets around 10 % of Europe’s demands,” says Kjetil Hove, executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway. The first stage of gas production from the Troll West gas province started in 2021 and included eight wells and a new pipeline to the Troll A platform, as well as a new inlet module. This part of the project helped extend plateau production by 5-7 years. Stage 2 will further extend plateau production by around four years and reduce the production decline over the next 10-12 years. Plateau production of Troll gas has increased as a result of recent upgrades at the Kollsnes processing plant. Maximum production from Troll used to be 121 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. This has now been increased to 129 million. Production from the new Troll wells will amount to about 20 million standard cubic metres of gas per day.

          "Reducing emissions from Sleipner and Gudrun Partial electrification of the Sleipner field centre and Gudrun platform will reduce annual emissions from the NCS by 160,000 tonnes of CO 2 . The project also helps reduce Nox emissions in the order of 700 tonnes per year. The Sleipner field centre is supplied with onshore power via a 28-km long cable from the Gina Krog platform, which is connected to Johan Sverdrup with onshore power. The Gina Krog platform was connected to onshore power in September 2023. Overall investments in the project total NOK 1.08 billion. A total of about 500,000 hours have been worked, approx. 200,000 of which took place offshore, without any unwanted HSE incidents. The Sleipner field has removed CO 2 from produced gas, captured, injected and stored around 20 million tonnes of CO 2 since the start in 1996. The licensees in the Sleipner East licence are Equinor Energy AS (operator, 59.6%), Vår Energi ASA (15.4%), PGNiG Upstream Norway AS (15.0%) and Orlen Upstream Norway 2 AS (10.0%). The licensees in the Gudrun licence are Equinor Energy AS (operator, 36.0%), Vår Energi Norge AS (25.0%), OMV (Norge) AS (24.0%) and Repsol Norway AS (15.0%). With the entire Utsira High now electrified, emissions amounting to approximately 1.2 million tonnes per year is saved. The Utsira High power grid includes the following installations: Johan Sverdrup, Gina Krog, Sleipner, Gudrun (all operated by Equinor), Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen (both operated by Aker BP). Partial electrification of the Sleipner field centre and Gudrun platform will reduce annual emissions from the NCS by 160,000 tonnes of CO 2 . The project also helps reduce Nox emissions in the order of 700 tonnes per year. The Sleipner field centre is supplied with onshore power via a 28-km long cable from the Gina Krog platform, which is connected to Johan Sverdrup with onshore power. The Gina Krog platform was connected to onshore power in September 2023. Overall investments in the project total NOK 1.08 billion.

The Utsira High power grid includes the following installations: Johan Sverdrup, Gina Krog, Sleipner, Gudrun (all operated by Equinor), Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen (both operated by Aker BP). The Sleipner field centre, along with the Gudrun platform and other associated fields, is now partly operating on power from shore. This will reduce annual emissions from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) by 160,000 tonnes of CO 2 . All installations on the Utsira High are now receiving power from shore, saving emissions amounting to about 1.2 million tonnes of CO ₂ per year. The electrification of the installations on the Utsira High is in line with the plan for development and operation (PDO) for Johan Sverdrup phase 2, which was approved by the Norwegian parliament in 2019. \"Electrification is the most effective tool in our toolbox in our quest to achieve the national target of halving greenhouse gas emissions from Norwegian oil and gas production by 2030,\" says Geir Tungesvik, executive vice president for Projects, Drilling & Procurement. One of two operative gas turbines on the Sleipner A platform will gradually be shut down as a relevant systems transition to using power from shore. The other gas turbine will stand by as a back-up power source during a run-in phase. In the longer run, Sleipner will have the opportunity to fully operate on power from shore. The Sleipner field centre has been supplied with onshore power via a cable from the Gina Krog platform since 24 March 2024. Starting on the same date, the Gudrun platform was connected to electricity through the existing cable to Sleipner. \"The Sleipner area has delivered vast volumes of energy, created long-term ripple effects and contributed substantial values to the Norwegian society. With power from shore, we can develop new discoveries and resources from low-emission production, and gas export from the area can be maintained for a long time to come,\" says Kjetil Hove, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. The Sleipner fields are among the largest gas producers in the North Sea and serve as a hub for gas transport to Europe. Norwegian gas plays an important role in the EU's energy transition. Now, also the gas that would otherwise be burnt on the installations can be utilised more effectively in Europe. \"The electrification of the Sleipner field centre has created important jobs and ripple effects for the Norwegian supply industry. I'm also very pleased with that we, our partners, and suppliers, have succeeded in implementing the project safely, with zero HSE incidents,\" Tungesvik says. Overall investments in the project total NOK 1.08 billion. In 2020, the Sleipner partnership exercised an option with Aibel for an EPCIC contract (engineering, procurement, construction,",
          "installation and commissioning) for the modification work on the Sleipner field centre. NKT was awarded the contract to manufacture and lay the power cables. The EPCIC contract has a value of about NOK 700 million and has contributed to 250 full-time equivalents at Aibel’s Stavanger office, offshore and at the shipyard in Haugesund. ABB has carried out substantial work as a sub-contractor within installation of high-voltage equipment and updating the power control system. Partial electrification of the Sleipner field centre and Gudrun platform will reduce annual emissions from the NCS by 160,000 tonnes of CO 2 . The project also helps reduce Nox emissions in the order of 700 tonnes per year. The Sleipner field centre is supplied with onshore power via a 28-km long cable from the Gina Krog platform, which is connected to Johan Sverdrup with onshore power.

          "Fourth phase of the world’s largest offshore wind farm Dogger Bank to unlock additional renewable power Commercial terms have been established with The Crown Estate in the UK to enable Dogger Bank D to progress, under an amendment to the existing seabed lease, subject to the final outcome of a ‘Plan-Level Habitats Regulations Assessment’ (HRA). The proposed fourth phase of the Dogger Bank Wind Farm will unlock up to 2GW of additional energy capacity from the wind farm’s existing seabed area. With the first three phases of the wind farm already set to power the equivalent of 6 million UK homes, this increased capacity will further accelerate the UK’s energy transition. Since the wind farm obtained a seabed lease in 2010 as part of the Crown Estate’s Offshore Wind Leasing Round 3, offshore wind technology has advanced, meaning that there is the potential for additional energy capacity to be generated within the same seabed footprint. Dogger Bank D, which is a 50/50 joint venture between Equinor and SSE Renewables, will utilise the eastern position of the Dogger Bank C area to unlock increased value. The amendment to the lease to allow the project to progress is subject to the outcome of the ‘Plan-Level Habitats Regulations Assessment’ (HRA) to understand the collective environmental impact of the additional capacity of Dogger Bank D alongside six further offshore wind farms exploring increases in capacity. This follows the announcement of The Crown Estate’s Capacity Improvement Programme in 2023, which looked to catalyse the UK’s energy transition, restore a thriving marine environment, and support growth for communities and industry. The Crown Estate is required to undertake the HRA before it is able to take a final decision on the Capacity Improvement Programme, and if Dogger Bank D is progressed the lease amendments will be subject to any additional provision which may need to be made to secure mitigation or compensatory measures in light of the findings of the HRA. Dogger Bank A, B and C, which are a joint venture between Equinor, SSE Renewables and Vårgrønn are currently being constructed in three 1.2GW phases. Production from Dogger Bank A started in October 2023. Before the new phase can be constructed, Dogger Bank D will require a new Development Consent Order. Commenting on the announcement, Trine Borum Bojsen, Equinor’s SVP Renewables said: “Dogger Bank D demonstrates how we can think differently about increasing value from quality existing assets across Equinor. By adding up to 2GW of capacity to the Dogger Bank area, we will unlock both value and volume. As a leading offshore wind player, we continue to develop innovative solutions across our portfolio.” Halfdan Brustad, Equinor’s VP UK Renewables said: “Reaching this milestone through close",
          "collaboration with our partner and The Crown Estate will help support the UK Government’s offshore wind and net zero ambitions, whilst building a competitive UK industry. Following first power, Dogger Bank, the world’s largest offshore wind farm, is a key example of what the offshore wind industry can offer, from security of electricity supply to economic growth and long-term jobs.” Rob Cussons, Dogger Bank D Project Director at SSE Renewables said: “I am delighted the shareholders in Dogger Bank D have been able to establish commercial terms to amend the Dogger Bank C lease with The Crown Estate, subject to the outcome of the Plan Level HRA and The Crown Estate’s final decision on the Capacity Improvement Programme. It is a move that can unlock the value of more clean energy from the same area of seabed, as we accelerate towards a greener and more secure energy system. This pioneering project is made possible by the joint foresight from shareholders SSE and Equinor along with The Crown Estate to consider an innovative approach to bring forward more clean and secure energy from the available seabed, whilst ensuring that sensitive marine habitats are protected.”",
          "Dogger Bank Wind Farm announces new £25 million commitment to coastal communities as long-term legacy for world-leading renewable energy project Dogger Bank Wind Farm has today announced additional funding of £25 million to support coastal communities across the North and North East of England over its planned 35-year operational lifespan. The fund will be used to enhance science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) education for young people during the planned 35-year operational lifespan of the wind farm, equipping them with the skills to succeed in a net zero world. The £25 million investment will be built on the £1 million community fund already invested in the North and North-East of England during the construction phase of the world’s largest offshore wind farm. The fund represents one of the largest community investments in offshore wind in the UK. The project has already created or supported over 2,000 jobs in the UK, contributing to 100,000+ UK offshore wind jobs needed to meet current national targets.

This announcement takes place during Wind Energy Week 2024 which showcases the industry’s achievements and discusses what is needed to accelerate large-scale growth. Set to be the world’s largest offshore wind farm once complete, Dogger Bank is situated over 130km from the Yorkshire coast and will produce enough renewable energy to supply electricity to six million homes in the UK annually. The wind farm, a joint venture between SSE Renewables, Equinor, and Vårgrønn, produced first power in October 2023. The new community fund builds on the £1 million community fund set up during the construction phase of Dogger Bank, which has already supported more than 36,000 young people across 204",
          "schools, provided 62 university scholarships, and provided 87 grants to local community groups. In addition to the Dogger Bank community funds, 50% of the wind farm’s rental payments to the Crown Estate will support the Coastal Communities Fund, a UK Government-funded initiative to support the economic growth of coastal areas. Under the current arrangement the funds received by the Coastal Communities Fund will equate to 1% of the wind farm’s gross revenue, which could amount to tens of millions of pounds being invested in coastal communities during the operation of Dogger Bank Wind Farm. Dogger Bank Wind Farm has also been a strong supporter of the Offshore Wind Growth Partnership (OWGP), playing a key role in advancing the offshore wind industry in the UK. RenewableUK's Chief Executive Dan McGrail said: \"Dogger Bank Wind Farm's commitment to provide a further £25 million to local communities in East Yorkshire and the North East of England shows that the offshore wind industry can provide significant economic benefits to coastal areas where renewable energy comes ashore and where our operation and maintenance centres are based. This funding will provide a boost to school pupils, university students and community groups, creating opportunities for new careers as well as getting much-needed community facilities built. Our industry is transforming the lives of people in coastal communities around the UK, and this is a great example of how this partnership works in action\". Dogger Bank’s community fund will continue to focus over the next 3 years on the key communities of East Riding of Yorkshire and Redcar & Cleveland where the renewable energy from the wind farm comes ashore, and South Tyneside, which is home to the wind farm’s operation and maintenance base. Once the project is fully commissioned, the community fund will continue to invest in each community, with an emphasis on the South Tyneside area, where the wind farm has a long-term presence. Mark Halliday, Dogger Bank Operations Director, said: \"Through the operations community fund, we continue to aim to empower and uplift communities by investing in projects that make a lasting impact. We are particularly excited to support the levelling up agenda by working with schools in the North and North East of England, where I personally grew up, by providing opportunities for STEM education. By fostering a passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, we hope to equip the next generation with the skills they need to be a part of a sustainable future.\" The operational fund will continue to focus on developing local skills and raising young people’s aspirations, to meet local priorities identified in consultation with the local education authorities in each key community. , The programme builds on recommendations made in",
          "a independent report by ekosgen, which described Dogger Bank Wind Farm as a market leader for its commitment to evaluating outcomes and areas for improvements in its community investment programme. The operational fund will be reviewed periodically in collaboration with local educational experts to ensure it meets the needs of local communities. In addition to this, the operational fund will provide an increased number of 30 scholarships per year, providing funding towards the cost of further education for local university students studying STEM subjects. The fund will also continue to support community projects and local organisations with grants of up to £1,000. Local organisations can now submit their applications through the Dogger Bank website. Oliver Cass, Dogger Bank Project Director, said: “It’s been our great privilege during the last three years to work with education providers and local communities to kickstart a programme of investment that is bringing long-term benefits for communities. “It is vitally important that developers work in partnership with local communities in order to sustainably deliver the critical green energy infrastructure that will shape our future.”",
          "Groundbreaking at South Brooklyn Marine Terminal to transform port into NYC offshore wind hub Revitalized SBMT will support Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 as offshore wind era advances in New York BROOKLYN, NEW YORK -- Equinor today broke ground on construction at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SBMT), kicking off the revitalization of the venerable port facility into a hub for offshore wind on the East Coast and a critical contributor to New York’s renewable energy ambitions. The groundbreaking ceremony included remarks from New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10), NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris, Executive Director of UPROSE Elizabeth Yeampierre, and President of Equinor Renewables Americas Molly Morris. SBMT will support Equinor’s first U.S. offshore wind project, Empire Wind 1, while placing Sunset Park and New York City at the heart of the renewable energy industry for decades to come. When completed, the facility will be one of the largest dedicated offshore wind hubs in the United States, designed to accommodate future offshore wind projects. “Today’s groundbreaking at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal is a defining moment for Empire Wind 1 and for the long-term renewable energy ambitions of New York State and beyond,” said Molly Morris, President of Equinor Renewables Americas. “We are proud to restore this historic working waterfront in Brooklyn and grateful for the shared commitment to offshore wind shown by this community and by city, state and federal leaders who made this milestone possible. This construction will result in union jobs and local economic benefits while supporting a project that will deliver homegrown power to New Yorkers and position the state as a leader in the advancing offshore wind industry.” The 73-acre construction project will create a staging and pre-assembly site for the turbine components of Empire Wind 1 and will include an onshore substation to connect 810 MW of wind power to the Gowanus substation, making Empire Wind 1 the first offshore wind project to connect directly into the New York City grid. SBMT will also be home to Empire Wind 1’s long-term Operations & Maintenance Base, which includes a control room that measures turbine data and monitors the project around-the-clock. SBMT is being developed as a low-emissions facility, with solar power and EV charging stations installed onsite. SBMT is being redeveloped together with New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) and terminal operator Sustainable South Brooklyn Marine Terminal (SSBMT).

          "Development consent granted for Equinor’s Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon Extension Projects in the UK The UK Secretary of State for the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero, has granted development consent to the Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon Extension Projects off the North Norfolk coast. The projects are extensions to the operational Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon Offshore Wind Farms, which currently power around 710,000 UK homes. The consent enables the Extension Projects to double the capacity of the existing wind farms, providing renewable energy to power an additional 785,000 UK homes. With these extensions, Equinor’s wind farms in Norfolk will power nearly 1.5 million households and make a significant contribution to the UK’s decarbonisation goals. The Dudgeon Offshore Wind Farm is owned by Equinor, Masdar and China Resources, whilst Sheringham Shoal Offshore Wind Farm is owned by Equinor, Equitix Offshore 5 (co-owned by Equitix and the Renewable Investment Group TRIG) and a fund managed by Macquarie Asset Management). This marks the first time in the UK that two offshore wind projects under separate ownership have been awarded consent under a shared application which provides the opportunity to combine development of the two projects. Through a coordinated approach and extensive consultations with local community members, Equinor has sought to develop the Extension Projects to maximise local benefits and minimise disruption. This includes an option in the consent application to utilise an integrated transmission system, as well as separate grid connections for each project, within the same overall onshore footprint. The development has been selected as a Pathfinder project for coordinated offshore transmission development under the UK Government’s Offshore Transmission Network Review. During the construction phase, the Extension Projects are anticipated to support more than 1800 full time jobs per year across the UK and within East Anglia, generating over £370 million in direct gross value added (GVA) to the East Anglia and UK economy. The projects are also planned to leverage the existing operations and maintenance base at Great Yarmouth, which will continue to serve the operational Sheringham Shoal and Dudgeon wind farms, as well as the new turbines once developed. Commenting on the Secretary of State’s decision, Halfdan Brustad, Equinor’s VP, UK Renewables, said: “We are delighted with the Secretary of State’s decision to award consent, doubling the capacity of the existing projects, and clearing the way forward to significantly contribute to the UK’s offshore wind and Net Zero targets by 2030. This is huge milestone for the joint venture partners in both Dudgeon and Sheringham Shoal extension projects. The Extension Projects have been developed carefully over the last five years, with innovative approaches to transmission planning and consenting, underpinned by close engagement with the local community. The extensions build",
          "on our longstanding presence in Norfolk and we look forward to contributing even more positively to the local region and the UK’s offshore wind growth.” Equinor will now review the consent granted in full detail and determine if and when the projects can be taken forward for Final Investment Decision (FID).",
          "Empire Wind 1 awarded offtake contract in New York’s fourth offshore wind solicitation round New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) today announced Equinor’s Empire Wind 1 project one of the conditional winners in its fourth offshore wind solicitation round. The award is an important milestone for the advancement of the project, which can deliver 810 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy to New York. An already highly mature offshore wind project, Empire Wind 1 targets to deliver first power to New York in 2026. Equinor and NYSERDA will now negotiate an Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate (OREC) Purchase and Sale Agreement, with contract execution expected within Q2 2024. “Today’s award is an important milestone in our continued efforts to maximize value creation from Empire Wind 1, currently one of the biggest and most mature renewables projects in the US. The award represents an important contribution to New York’s climate ambitions from a large-scale project in a growth market that has demonstrated a strong commitment to offshore wind. We are working diligently to bring the project to an investment decision during the third quarter of this year. With the use of project financing, we currently expect our US East Coast offshore wind investments to deliver full-cycle nominal equity returns within the range of 12-16%. We intend to farm down to a new partner at the right time to further enhance value and reduce our exposure,” said Pål Eitrheim, executive vice president of Equinor Renewables. Subject to signing of the OREC contract with NYSERDA, the project is expected to deliver forward looking real base project returns within the guided range for renewable projects of 4-8%. Following a final investment decision expected mid-2024, Equinor plans to use project financing, with financial close anticipated by end of 2024. Full-cycle nominal equity returns for the US East Coast offshore wind investments is currently expected within the range of 12-16%. Equinor also intends to bring in a partner to enhance value and reduce ownership share and exposure. Empire Wind 1 has already achieved several key permitting milestones, including approval of its Construction and Operations Plan (COP) from the Federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and its Article VII Certificate of Environmental Capability and Public Need from the New York Public Service Commission. On 25 January 2024, Equinor announced a swap transaction with bp, under which Equinor will take full ownership of the Empire Wind lease and projects and bp will take full ownership of the Beacon Wind lease and projects. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and closing of the transaction is expected in Q2 or Q3 2024. Equinor delivered adjusted operating income* of USD 7.48 billion and USD 2.15 billion after tax"

In the quarter, Equinor completed seven exploration wells offshore, including the Argerich well in Argentina, with no commercial discoveries. Seven wells were ongoing at the quarter end. In the second quarter, Equinor produced 655 GWh from renewables, up 90% from the same quarter last year. Production from onshore power plants contributed with more than half of the production in the quarter, mainly from the Rio Energy assets and Mendubim solar plants in Brazil, as well as new production in Poland. The offshore windfarms contributed to the growth with strong production. Equinor’s NCS portfolio progressed in the quarter. Equinor and its partners made an investment decision for further development of gas infrastructure in the Troll West gas province, contributing to energy security to Europe long-term. The Johan Castberg FPSO left the dock for inshore testing and is on track for sail away to the Barents Sea later this summer. The production started from the partner-operated Hanz field in April and from the Kristin South area in July. Equinor continued to optimise the portfolio through strategic business development. This quarter an agreement with Petoro was announced to harmonise equity interest in the Haltenbanken area to increase long-term value creation, and a divestment of interests in the Gina Krog area. The swap transaction to increase profitability in the US onshore business, exiting the operated position in Ohio and increasing its position in partner-operated assets in Northern Marcellus in Pennsylvania was closed. Equinor accessed CO 2 storage capacity opportunities of 17 million tonnes per year with the awarded three new licences Kinna and Albondigas on the NCS, and the Kalundborg licence onshore Denmark. In the UK, construction is progressing on Dogger Bank A offshore wind farm with 27 turbines either fully or partly installed.

          "Equinor expands renewables portfolio in Poland with a new solar plant Equinor’s third solar plant in Poland, Lipno has started test production. This brings the company’s onshore renewables capacity in Poland to ~200 MW, and further strengthens its position in one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets in Europe. Lipno is located in the Wielkopolskie province in central Poland. The 53 MW solar plant was developed and will be operated by the Polish renewable power producer Wento, Equinor’s 100% subsidiary. Material merchant portfolio Equinor acquired Wento and its 1.6 GW pipeline of solar projects in 2021. Three years after the acquisition, Wento has grown from a small-scale solar developer into a multi-tech power producer operating three solar plants and one onshore wind park in Poland with a total capacity of ~200 MW. “Wento’s journey showcases how we leverage our investments in local development companies to build a material and profitable onshore renewables business in select markets,” says Anders Bade, senior vice president for onshore and markets within Renewables at Equinor. Accumulated annual production from the portfolio operated by Wento is estimated at approximately 280 GWh of power per year, which is equivalent to the electricity consumption of around 140,000 Polish households. Equinor’s energy trading house Danske Commodities has signed a balancing agreement with the Lipno solar plant and will be responsible for commercializing the produced power in the Polish power market. Lipno is expected to yield returns in line with prior guidance for renewables in Equinor. Danske Commodities provides route-to-market for Wento’s assets in operation, building upon almost 15 years of power trading experience in Poland. “We have developed a distinct business model that allows us to efficiently scale our onshore renewables portfolio and create value uplift from power trading,” says Anders Bade. Building for profitable growth Since the acquisition, Wento has built on its project pipeline, effectively doubling it to over 3 GW of opportunities in various stages of maturity. The pipeline has been diversified beyond power generation to also include battery storage, which adds flexibility and enhances value creation potential. “Poland is actively developing renewable energy to increase domestic power capacity and enhance energy security. For Wento and Equinor, this represents an exciting opportunity to be a leading player in a growing renewable energy market,” says Wojciech Cetnarski, CEO of Wento. Earlier this year, Wento won the Polish Capacity Market Auction with four battery storage projects totalling about 400 MW/1,6 GWh. The final investment decisions for the projects are expected in the next years. Battery storage systems will be key for Poland’s future grid stability as the country increases the share of renewable power.

Equinor will increase its ownership in the Heidrun field and Noatun discovery and reduce its ownership in the Tyrihans field and the Castberg field, as well as the Carmen and Beta discoveries. “We have a strategy to continue the development and the value creation on the Norwegian continental shelf and expect to maintain a high production with lower emissions towards 2035. Alignment of ownership around the larger production hubs are important enablers for long-term value creation,” says Kjetil Hove, executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway. Heidrun and Tyrihans are two of the largest producing fields in the Halten area in the Norwegian Sea. Heidrun is among the fields with the longest remaining life on the Norwegian continental shelf. “Although this is a value-neutral swap, this alignment of ownership will add more value to all parties from the Halten-area over time. Balanced partnerships will simplify commercial agreements, lower operating costs, and accelerate new developments with added production at a lower cost,” Hove continues. Currently, Equinor holds a low equity interest in the Heidrun field of 13.0%, while Petoro has an equity interest of 57.8%. For Tyrihans, Equinor’s ownership is high, at 58.8%, while Petoro does not hold any equity. Following the completion of the transaction, Equinor will own 34.4% in Heidrun and 36.3% in Tyrihans, while Petoro will own 36.4% in Heidrun and 22.5% in Tyrihans.

Production on the Norwegian continental shelf was high, and the international portfolio contributed with solid production growth. We continue with significant capital distribution and expect to deliver a total distribution of 14 billion dollars in 2024.” “We remain a safe and reliable provider of energy to Europe. On the NCS we got approval for the Eirin project and the Sleipner and Gudrun fields are now partially operating with power from shore, all contributing to lower cost and emissions from production.” “We maintain a value-driven approach to renewables growth. In the quarter, we achieved significantly better terms for our Empire Wind 1 project in the US and started the commercial production from the Mendubim solar plants in Brazil.” Equinor delivered a total equity production of 2,164 mboe per day in the first quarter, up from 2,130 mboe per day in the same quarter last year. The growth is driven by strong operational performance. Increased capacity at Johan Sverdrup and ramp up of Breidablikk, in addition to new wells on stream, contributed to increased growth on the Norwegian continental shelf. The Vito field in the US Gulf of Mexico and the Buzzard field in the UK, in addition to new wells in Angola",
          "contributed to 3% production growth internationally. In the first quarter, Equinor produced 774 GWh from renewables, up 48% from the same quarter last year. The growth came primarily from onshore power plants in Brazil, in which Rio Energy was the key contributor. Higher production from the offshore windfarms also supported the increased power production. The activity level on the NCS was high throughout the quarter. The plan for development of the Eirin field, a subsea tieback to Gina Krog, was approved in the quarter and the field is expected to contribute with gas volumes from next year. In April, Equinor announced the start-up of electrification of the Sleipner field centre, along with the Gudrun platform and other associated fields, which is expected to further reduce emissions from the operations. Equinor continued to optimise its oil and gas portfolio with the recent swap transaction in the US onshore business, exiting the operated position in Ohio and increasing its position in partner-operated assets in Northern Marcellus in Pennsylvania. Equinor will pay a cash consideration of USD 500 million to balance the overall transaction. In the quarter, Equinor completed nine exploration wells offshore with two commercial discoveries. Three wells were ongoing at the quarter end. The company was awarded 39 new production licenses on the NCS. During the quarter Equinor secured a significantly improved offtake price for its Empire Wind 1 project on the US East Coast. Planned next steps include final investment decision, project financing and farm down to a new partner. In Brazil, production started at the 531 MW Mendubim solar plants, where Equinor has a 30% ownership share. Equinor realised a price for piped gas to Europe of USD 9.41 per MMbtu and realised an average liquids price of USD 76.0 per bbl, down 50% and up 3% respectively, compared to the first quarter 2023. Equinor delivered solid adjusted operating income* of USD 7.53 billion and USD 2.57 billion after tax. This is down from the same quarter last year due to lower gas prices but partially offset by production growth and increased liquids prices. In this quarter, the company introduced two new performance measures, namely adjusted net income* and adjusted earnings per share*, with the purpose to provide additional transparency to Equinor’s underlying financial performance. In addition, effective as of this quarter, the adjustment for over- and underlift has been removed from adjusted operating income* (previously named \"adjusted earnings\"). The Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP) segment delivered adjusted operating income* of USD 887 million, above the guided range for the segment, mainly driven by strong results from liquids and LNG trading.

          "Equinor swaps onshore assets in the US EQT Corporation and Equinor closed the transaction on May 31 2024 after receiving the necessary approvals. Equinor and EQT Corporation have agreed to swap Equinor’s operated position in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Ohio for a stake in EQT’s non-operated interest in the Northern Marcellus formation. EQT Corporation and Equinor closed the transaction on May 31 2024 after receiving the necessary approvals. Under the transaction agreement, Equinor will sell 100% interest in and operatorship of its onshore asset in the Appalachian Basin, located in southeastern Ohio, in exchange for 40% of EQT’s non-operated working interest in the Northern Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania. Equinor will pay a cash consideration of USD 500 million to EQT to balance the overall transaction, swapping for resources that contribute to growing cashflows and further reducing CO 2 emissions intensity in the international portfolio. Following the transaction, Equinor will increase its average working interest from 15.7% to 25.7% in certain Chesapeake-operated Northern Marcellus gas units. To cover pre-existing gas sales commitments, Equinor will enter a gas buy-back agreement with EQT. “With this transaction, we continue to high-grade the US portfolio and improve profitability by strengthening our gas position in the most robust part of the Appalachian Basin. These assets are well positioned to leverage anticipated positive developments in the US gas market. The proposed swap improves portfolio robustness with an expected reduction in well break-evens and upstream carbon intensity. This also means that we have now fully exited all operated positions onshore US,” says Philippe Mathieu, executive vice president for Exploration and Production International at Equinor. “The US is a core area for Equinor where we’re building a broad energy business within offshore and onshore oil and gas, offshore wind, and new low-carbon value chains,” says Mathieu. Since 2020, Equinor’s US business has recorded USD 11 billion in earnings. Prior to this transaction, the Appalachian Basin operated position was the last remaining operatorship held by Equinor in the US onshore. EQT Corporation is the largest producer of natural gas in the US with operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Final completion will, among other things, be dependent on approval by relevant authorities.

Aimed at celebrating companies which demonstrate an outstanding commitment to engaging with the supply chain, the Supply Chain Gold Award was presented at OEUK’s Share Fair event in Aberdeen on Wednesday, March 20th. Equinor secured its gold status following the Working as One Survey, which saw the company identified as a leading performer and ranked highly amongst its suppliers and peer organisations, whilst being aligned with OEUK’s supply chain principles. The principles outline best practice to promote good behaviours and ensure collaborative working with the supply chain. Equinor is also committed to the North Sea Transition Authority’s (NSTA) Stewardship Expectation 12 , which further reinforces these expectations. Julie McWilliam, supply chain manager at Equinor, said: “We pride ourselves on being a trusted and collaborative partner when working with our suppliers, and are proud to have achieved this award for the second year running. Our hard-working supply chain is a vital part of successful business operations. We hope the variety of suppliers we met with at the Share Fair event felt the benefit of this collaborative approach and we look forward to strengthening relationships further.”",
          "Equinor presents 2023 integrated Annual Report Equinor ASA publishes 2023 integrated Annual Report, combining financial and sustainability reporting. “In 2023 geopolitical tensions and challenging macroeconomics drove volatility in the energy markets, making access to affordable and sustainable energy less secure. Equinor continues to broaden our portfolio, to deliver the energy needed today, while developing the energy solutions for tomorrow,” says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. The report for 2023 integrates the annual financial and sustainability reporting, reflecting the importance of sustainability for Equinor’s operational and financial performance, to our people, investors and other stakeholders. Safety first “Everyone should be safe working for Equinor. It is encouraging that our safety performance indicators have seen a positive development over time. Two accidents that took two lives during the last year give a stark contrast to the positive trend. We continue to reinforce our effort to ensure that all our people return safely home from work”, says Opedal. The two fatalities were the tragic SAR helicopter accident in February 2024 and the man-overboard emergency at a contracted tanker in Malaysia in August 2023. The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) for 2023 was 0.4, stable from 2022. Strong operational and financial performance Equinor delivered the second-highest financial result in the history of the company, with adjusted earnings* of USD 36.2 billion. Adjusted earnings after tax* totalled USD 10.4 billion. Net operating income was reported at USD 35.8 billion and net income at USD 11.9 billion. During 2023 Equinor contributed to energy security through safe, secure, and reliable energy production, while continuing to build production capacity and progressing on the energy transition. Solid operations across the portfolio contributed to a growth in equity liquids and gas production of 2.1%, to 2,082 mboe per day in 2023. Equity production of power from renewable power sources increased by 17% to 1,937 GWh. Strong financial result resulted in a return on average capital employed (RoACE)* at 25% for 2023. Capital discipline remained firm with organic capital expenditures* ending at USD 10.2 billion for the year. Equinor maintained a strong balance sheet with net debt ratio* of negative 21.6% at the end of 2023, compared to negative 23.9% at the end of 2022. In 2023 Equinor stepped up capital distribution to shareholders to a total of USD 17 billion, including extraordinary dividend and share buy backs. The strong financial results of 2023 also led to strong contributions to society through taxes. In 2023, Equinor paid USD 28 billion in corporate income taxes of which USD 27 billion was paid in Norway, where Equinor has the largest share of its operations and earnings. Progressing on the strategy Equinor continued to make progress on the strategy to",
          "optimise oil and gas, accelerate high value growth in renewables and develop new market opportunities in low carbon solutions. The industrial progress was strong through the year. On the Norwegian continental shelf, the Bauge and Breidablikk fields came on stream, the Johan Sverdrup field achieved a higher plateau production and Equinor increased the ownership share and took over operatorship of the Linnorm discovery. Equinor continued to optimise and focus its international oil and gas portfolio with the final investment decisions on Rosebank in UK, Raia in Brazil and the partner-operated Sparta in the USA, and announcing divestments of assets and exits from Nigeria and Azerbaijan. The renewable portfolio progressed with the floating windfarm Hywind Tampen on the NCS in full production and the first power from Dogger Bank A in UK late in the year. The acquisitions of the onshore renewables platforms BeGreen in Denmark and Rio Energy in Brazil contributed to a 8 GW growth of the renewables pipeline for the year. Low carbon solutions saw progress of regulatory frameworks in key markets for Equinor. Equinor continued the progress of market opportunities and projects within low carbon solutions with the acquisition of an interest in the CCS project Bayou Bend in the US. Progress on the Energy transition plan 2023 was a year of execution and capacity building for the Energy transition plan, against a backdrop of continued energy security concerns and new market challenges. The ambitions of the plan remain unchanged, including the ambition to become a net zero emissions company by 2050. An increased share of oil in the oil and gas production in 2023 caused a small increase in net carbon intensity of energy produced. At the same time, gross investments to renewables and low carbon solutions increased from 14% in 2022 to 20% in 2023. Equinor’s operated scope 1+2 GHG emissions were 11.6 million tonnes of CO2e, a slight increase on 2022 levels, but 30% lower than 2015, which is the reference year of Equinor’s ambition to reduce group-wide operated emissions by 50% on a net basis by 2030. Actions taken to reduce operated emissions throughout 2023, like the startup of power from shore to the Gina Krog field and the completion of the Hywind Tampen windfarm powering the Snorre and Gullfaks fields, are expected to contribute to achievement of the ambition in the coming years. The average upstream CO2 intensity of Equinor’s operated portfolio was 6.7 kg of CO2 per boe in 2023 (100% basis), down from 6.9kg of CO2/boe in 2022 and well below the industry average. The increase in oil and gas production led to scope 3 GHG emissions increasing 3% from 2022 to 250 million tonnes in 2023. * * *",

          "Two thousand jobs maintained through four-year drilling contracts Equinor, on behalf of the partners, is exercising two options to extend contracts with Archer AS, KCA Deutag Drilling Norway AS and Odfjell Operations AS for a total of four years. The options for drilling services on fixed installations on the Norwegian continental shelf provide jobs for 2000 people per year, and have an estimated value of NOK 18.4 billion. The contracts were signed in 2018 with three option periods of two years. The first two-year option was exercised in 2022. The new contract period runs for four years from 1 October 2024. \"We appreciate the good collaboration we have had with these suppliers for many years, and have therefore added a fourth option of two years in addition to those agreed in the original contracts. This will help ensure predictability and form the basis for continuous improvements over time. This is a clear signal that we have long-term plans for cooperation with all three suppliers,\" says Mette H. Ottøy, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. In this option round, Equinor has conducted a limited competition evaluating drilling suppliers on certain fixed installations based on a combination of technical and commercial criteria. This has resulted in some redistribution between these suppliers on four of the 19 installations in the contract portfolios. The services they deliver to Equinor are drilling, completion, intervention services, plugging, maintenance and modifications on 19 of Equinor’s fixed installations. They also get support from sub-contractors for some of these services, generating additional jobs along the Norwegian coast. “We know these suppliers well, and look forward to continued collaboration about safety improvements, energy management and operational efficiency.

          "Production start at the Mendubim solar plant The 531 MW Mendubim solar plant in Brazil has come into operation. This marks a 30% increase in Equinor’s equity power production in Brazil. “Mendubim represents an important contribution to Equinor’s diversified energy offering in Brazil that includes a robust oil and gas portfolio and an attractive renewables position,” says Veronica Coelho, Equinor’s country manager in Brazil. Mendubim will annually produce 1.2 TWh of power. Around 60% of the power will be sold on a 20-year USD-denominated power purchase agreement (PPA) with Alunorte, one of the world’s leading suppliers of alumina for the aluminium industry. The remaining production will be sold in the power market in Brazil. The asset is expected to deliver real base project returns in the middle of Equinor’s guided range for renewables of 4-8%. The project is developed and operated as a joint venture between Scatec, Hydro Rein and Equinor. All three partners have an equal economic interest of 30% in the project. In conjunction with the start of commercial operations, Alunorte has exercised its call option and now holds the remaining 10%. Olav Kolbeinstveit, senior vice president for onshore and markets within Renewables at Equinor, says: “Launching a major new solar plant in Brazil in partnership with Scatec and Hydro Rein is an important achievement. Equinor has conducted business in Brazil for over two decades, and we see the country as a core area for long-term profitable growth. By investing in renewable energy, we are supporting Brazil’s ambitions towards a diverse energy mix and helping to meet the expected power demand growth in the country.” Terje Pilskog, CEO of Scatec, states, “This project marks a pivotal milestone in realizing our strategic objectives and reinforces our position in a prominent renewable energy growth market, bolstered by our partners Equinor and Hydro Rein. The burgeoning solar energy market in Brazil aligns with our commitment to sustainable progress, and we are excited to advance this impactful project with approximately 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents avoided”. Olivier Girardot, CEO of Hydro Rein, states, “We are thrilled to complete the first of Hydro Rein’s renewable energy projects in Brazil. Our mission is to develop renewable energy solutions for more sustainable industries, and Mendubim does just that. Most of the power output will go to Hydro’s alumina refinery Alunorte in Pará, supporting one of the largest decarbonization projects in the world. We are very proud to take part in this development together with Equinor and Scatec.” Brazil is the largest power market in South America, with expected significant demand growth. Deregulation of the power market is ongoing, and the de-regulated market is now accounting for about 40% of total consumption. With Mendubim",
          "in operation, Equinor increases its equity power production in Brazil by around 30%, bringing it to over 1,4 TWh during 2024. Through Mendubim, Equinor also for the first time enters the de-regulated power market in Brazil. Equinor’s total renewables power generation in 2023 was ~ 2 TWh with an outlook to double it in 2024. “We are working to build a material and profitable power portfolio in Brazil. Our energy trading house Danske Commodities will increasingly manage this portfolio in the Brazilian market, leveraging their trading and portfolio risk management capabilities to maximize value creation”, says Kolbeinstveit. Equinor’s renewables position in Brazil includes three assets in commercial production: the 162 MW Apodi solar plant (44%), the 531 MW Mendubim solar plant (30%) and the 223 MW Serra da Babilônia 1 onshore wind farm (100%). There is also an over 1,5 GW pipeline of solar and onshore wind projects being matured by Equinor’s fully owned subsidiary Rio Energy. Equinor delivered adjusted operating income* of USD 7.48 billion and USD 2.15 billion after tax in the second quarter of 2024. Equinor reported net operating income of USD 7.66 billion and net income at USD 1.87 billion. Adjusted net income* was USD 2.42 billion, leading to adjusted earnings per share* of USD 0.84. Equinor (OSE: EQNR, NYSE: EQNR) will on 25 July 2024 commence the third tranche of up to USD 1.6 billion of the share buy-back programme for 2024, as announced in relation with the second quarter results 24 July 2024.

          "Equinor secures exploration permit for CO₂ storage in Denmark In 2023 The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) made five onshore areas in Denmark available for CCS applications and received this year interest from several companies that want to investigate storing of CO 2 in the selected areas. Permits for subsurface exploration are initially granted for up to six years with the option of extension up to a total of ten years. If the license area meets all environmental requirements and is deemed suitable for safe CO 2 storage by the Danish authorities, the permit holder has priority to apply for a storage permit. The permit can last for up to 30 years with the possibility of extension. After that, the project will enter a closure phase where the wells are plugged and the CO 2 in the subsurface is continuously monitored, according to the DEA. Equinor in Denmark Equinor opened an office in Copenhagen in January 2024 to build a strong foothold in the country, focusing on recruitment and business opportunities within the renewable energy industry and low carbon solutions. We are also present in Denmark through our subsidiaries Danske Commodities, an energy trading house, and the leading solar developer BeGreen. Equinor has been awarded its first CCS exploration permit in Denmark as operator, together with partners Ørsted and Nordsøfonden. The partnership will start surveys to assess if the onshore licence in the North West Zealand can be developed into a safe CO 2 storage facility. The partners were today awarded permit holders for the project named CO 2 Storage Kalundborg, with a reservoir approximately 1400 meters below ground, and with a potential capacity to store up to 12 million tons of CO 2 per year. If the partnership over the next years successfully develops the permit into a CO 2 storage facility approved by the Danish authorities, it could start storage of CO 2 at the end of this decade. “We are delighted to receive this exploration permit together with Ørsted and Nordsøfonden. Developing large-scale CO 2 solutions is critical for hard-to-abate industries to reduce emissions while maintaining industrial activity and value creation. Our first important task in the project is to ensure that environmental requirements are met before seismic and subsurface data collection can start. The exploration phase will last several years, before the Danish authorities approves the licence area as suitable for safe and permanent CO 2 storage,” says Grete Tveit, senior vice president for Low Carbon Solutions in Equinor. Operator Equinor holds a 60 per cent share in the awarded exploration licence, with partner Ørsted having a 20 percent stake, and the Danish state participating through Nordsøfonden with a 20 percent equity. Equinor expects a 4-8 per",
          "cent real base project return for its early phase CO 2 storage business, and further value uplift potential when commercial markets are developed. “We will use our experience from safely storing CO 2 on the Norwegian Continental Shelf for nearly 30 years and other CCS developments when exploring the permit in Denmark. Maturing more CO 2 storage capacity aligns with our ambition of having 30 to 50 million tonnes of CO 2 transport and storage capacity per year by 2035. A CO 2 storage facility near Ørsted’s existing infrastructure is a good fit, as we are combining our strong capabilities as industry partners to establish a complete end-to-end CO 2 capture, transport and storage value chain,” says Tveit. The awarded licence is located near Ørsted’s established shipping and storage terminal, Ørsted Kalundborg CO 2 hub. Here the Danish energy company is constructing a CO 2 capture facility at the Asnæs Power Plant, which is set to become operational from the beginning of 2026, with CO 2 ship export to the Northern Lights storage facility in Norway. Ørsted’s terminal with its strategic position and scale will be a key component for reception and transport of CO 2 to the potential CO 2 storage facility the partnership will explore. “We are pleased that we, along with Equinor and Nordsøfonden, have been awarded a licence to explore whether the area in the municipality of Kalundborg is suitable for carbon storage. From 2026, we will capture 430,000 tonnes of biogenic CO 2 from two of our combined heat and power plants, and being part of this collaboration is a natural next step in building our Ørsted Kalundborg CO 2 Hub, as we are already establishing the logistics, infrastructure, and terminal solutions necessary for handling CO 2 at Kalundborg. In this way, we are a good partner to Equinor, who will be operating the CO 2 storage site\" says Ole Thomsen, senior vice president and head of Ørsted’s Bioenergy business.

          "Equinor awarded two new CO₂ storage licences in the North Sea Equinor has been awarded the operatorships for the development of two new CO 2 storages in the North Sea. The new licences are important building blocks for developing the Norwegian Continental Shelf into a leading area for CO 2 storage in Europe. On 20 June, the Ministry of Energy announced the award of new CO 2 storage licences. Equinor was awarded operatorships and a 100 per cent share for the two licences referred to as Albondigas and Kinno. The new licences are each expected to have the capacity to store around 5 million tonnes of CO 2 per year when in operation. This estimate will be further determined in the exploration phase. “We are very pleased to see the Norwegian authorities have made new CCS storage acreage available for exploration and that we have been awarded these two licences. We see that demand for CO 2 storage is increasing in several countries, and it is crucial to bring forward new CO 2 storages quickly, so that we can offer industrial solutions that can support large scale decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries in Europe,” says Grete Tveit, senior vice president for Low Carbon Solutions in Equinor. Equinor expects 4-8 per cent real base project returns for its early phase CO 2 storage business, and further value uplift potential when commercial markets are developed. The award of the Albondigas and Kinno licences adds to Equinor’s ambitions to develop more storage licences in the North Sea in the coming years. Equinor is maturing a ship-based solution as well as a large pipeline to connect industrial emissions in Europe with storage opportunities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The planned pipeline, named CO 2 Highway Europe, will have the capacity to transport 25 – 35 million tonnes of CO 2 per year from Belgium and France. The Smeaheia storage licence, awarded to Equinor in 2022, is the anchor storage for this pipeline development and Albondigas and Kinno will be additional storage opportunities that can be connected. Equinor is also about to complete the first phase of the Northern Lights CO 2 transport and storage facility together with Shell and Total Energies. The facility will be ready to receive CO 2 by the second half of this year. “Scale-up of CO 2 transport and storage is essential to meet the interest and demand for this type of services. Gaining access to more CO 2 storage capacity aligns well with our ambition of having 30 to 50 million tonnes of CO 2 transport and storage capacity per year by 2035,” says Tveit.

          "Improving future pipeline visibility and certainty to enable supply chain investment Opinion piece – 6 minute read 1. Playing to the UK’s strengths 2. Targeted Government support 3. Improving future pipeline visibility and certainty How can the UK compete with the likes of the EU and the US in attracting supply chain investment in offshore wind? Opinion piece – 6 minute read I joined Equinor’s UK Renewables division in September 2023 following five years of working in the UK’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), where I led the UK’s Offshore Transmission Network Review (OTNR) 1 . I was appointed to Renewable UK’s Shadow Board 2 in January 2024, which has allowed me to connect with others in a wide variety of roles across the industry and to better understand some of the key challenges and opportunities the sector faces. As a Civil Servant, my colleagues and I spent a lot of time thinking about how government policy can enable private sector investment, where targeted intervention is needed to address market failures and how the UK can ensure its renewables success story continues and maximises the associated economic benefits. All issues that are still highly pertinent as the industry heads to Global Offshore Wind in Manchester this week and as the country prepares to vote in a General Election on July 4th. Now working in a global offshore wind developer that is developing some of the biggest and most innovative offshore wind farms in world, right here in the UK, it’s been no surprise just how much policy makers in countries around the world are keen to learn from our experience in the UK when developing their own offshore wind regimes. For the UK, the downside of being world leading of course, is that everyone else can learn from your mistakes and missteps. So, in the context of a global competition for capital allocation in board rooms of offshore wind developers, the UK can’t afford to rest on its laurels when it comes to maintaining its position as one of the most attractive places in the world to develop offshore wind. Despite this, while the UK is second only to China in terms of deployment, it has relatively underperformed in translating GW installed into inward supply chain investment, as highlighted in the recent report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) 3 . The UK is not alone in pushing for more local content, but of course one project doesn’t make a factory and you can’t build a factory for each project in each country – particularly not in geographically proximate markets around the North Sea. So how can the UK compete with the likes of the",
          "EU and the US in attracting this supply chain investment when it comes to offshore wind? It’s widely accepted that to compete on the depth of our pockets would be unsustainable. So, what else can we do? 1. Playing to the UK’s strengths 2. Targeted Government support 3. Improving future pipeline visibility and certainty On 1, we’ve already seen some great progress with publication of the UK’s Industrial Growth Plan 4 , which is a cold-eyed assessment and prioritisation of where UK competitive advantage could lie. On 2, there has been a recognition of the Government support needed at different stages both in terms of upfront capital investment through the £1bn Green Industries Growth Accelerator 5 and the plans to support developers in making more local and sustainable procurement choices through Sustainable Industry Rewards 6 which are expected to be introduced from CfD Allocation Round 7. Despite the election, the hope is both schemes are continued or expanded by a new government. However, on 3, I’m afraid more is required as we’re still taking a project-by-project approach to supply chain development and despite welcome Government funding to help get investment decisions over the line we risk failing to have the desired impact in the face of a lack of investment certainty. This is particularly the case following the failure of CfD Allocation Round 5 to bring forward any new offshore wind projects and with overly conservative reference prices for Allocation Round 6 only expected to bring forward a further 3-5GW, despite DESNZ increasing the auction price cap by 66% and setting a budget four times bigger than Allocation Round 5 at £800m. This potentially leaves Allocation Round 7 in 2025, the last CfD round with a delivery window to 2030, needing to do a lot of heavy lifting to keep any 2030 targets within reach. In my five years at DESNZ offshore wind targets went from 30GW, to 40GW, to 50GW, all by 2030! According to RenewableUK’s Energy Pulse database 7 the UK pipeline stands at around 90GW, which even with some attrition, should be more than enough to deliver a decarbonised power system. So, the key questions in relation to any 2030 targets for a new government are A) how to maximise the number of projects getting through the consenting process to be eligible for AR7? and B) how to maximise the volume that can be delivered through AR6 and AR7 whilst still maintaining competitive tension and getting the best deal for consumers? UK electricity demand is expected to double between now and 2050 as other parts of the economy are electrified. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) estimates the UK will need up to 125GW of offshore wind",
          "by 2050. 8 The UK has committed to a further 20-30GW of new seabed leasing by 2030 and wants a further 12GW of floating wind in the Celtic Sea. 9 However, there is currently no clarity for the industry or the supply chain on the future level of government ambition post-2030 or a detailed forward schedule of seabed leasing rounds setting out what volumes will come forward where and when. From a supply chain and cost perspective, one of the worst scenarios would be for a big glut of projects to all come through at the same time with no long-term visibility of what is coming afterwards. This would likely see the supply chain reluctant to invest for fear of overcapacity in the long-term, with projects competing for the same limited supply chain capacity in the short-term, pushing up prices and causing delays. This is essentially what happened in seabed leasing round 3 in 2010, where 25GW of projects came forward all at once and then got mired in delays and planning challenges, some of which are still not delivered, and I would argue did relatively little for supply chain certainty. A risk we’re in danger of repeating with ScotWind. So how do we avoid a cycle of ‘boom and bust’ for the sector? Action on future leasing is needed to create longer-term forward visibility of a pipeline of de-risked projects. This would create certainty of demand for the supply chain and enable them to invest over the short-term and maintain the jobs they support over the long-term. European offshore wind markets are leading the UK in terms of providing visibility of their future ambitions and leasing rounds. For instance, Germany has already established legal targets of 30 GW in 2030, 40 GW in 2035, and 70 GW in 2045. 10 It has completed its Marine Spatial Prioritisation and identified areas of the seabed to be leased, with a forward plan of auctions to inform industry of the volume, timing, and location of leasing. German auctions also include the seabed lease, grid connection, and front-load site development, which reduces risk and accelerates delivery. The UK is moving in a similar direction when it comes to thinking about grid alongside leasing and front-loading site development, with The Crown Estate’s welcome approach to Leasing Round 5 and beyond, following recommendations from the OTNR. 11 However, we could go further and set out clear long-term targets per technology for 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050 based on recommendations from the CCC, which can be in input into the creation of a Strategic Spatial Energy Plan (SSEP) led by the new National Energy System Operator. Any targets that are set will inevitably need to be",
          "revised periodically as factors change and the SSEP is updated, but importantly would give industry and supply chain a clear signal for delivering minimum annual capacity targets. Minimum annual capacity targets could also enable a more mechanistic approach to the CfD allocation framework, with each auction having clear capacity targets per technology over a multi-year period with a budget to match. Competitive tension and therefore downward pressure on auction prices could be maintained by managing pipeline throughput, however this would ultimately still require each auction to be oversubscribed and for the pace of deployment to effectively be throttled. That said, as long as annual capacity targets are being met, maybe it’s a good thing for consumers that only the most competitive projects in each round secure a CfD? This of course fails to recognise that any projects coming into the CfD auction will have already competed to win a seabed lease in the first place and have spent £10m’s in securing consent and will ultimately be displacing more expensive and polluting forms of generation. An alternative approach that maybe avoids being penny-wise and pound-foolish, taken from the report of the UK’s Offshore Wind Champion 12 , could be to automatically award projects a CfD once they achieve consent, provided they can deliver under a certain price. The key challenge for Government would be in setting this price, which they have a lot of experience in doing, but Allocation Round 5 shows what happens when they get this wrong. Either of these approaches could provide a step change in visibility and certainty to the supply chain allowing them to plan and make investments with the confidence that there will be a steady and reliable pipeline of projects coming through on an annual basis. And the best bit, particularly for a new Government that may be fiscally constrained, is that providing more visibility and long-term certainty doesn’t cost anything additional. The pieces of the jigsaw that have been missing thus far in preventing the UK from maximising the benefits from the green transition are starting to fall into place. However, to solve this particular puzzle we may need to borrow with pride from others who have had the benefit of learning from our mistakes.",
          "Equinor and GRTgaz sign agreement to develop CO2 transport infrastructure in France Equinor and main French gas transmission operator GRTgaz sign project development agreement (PDA) for a CO 2 transport system for captured CO 2 from industrial emitters in France to safe and permanent storage offshore Norway via the planned CO 2 Highway Europe pipeline project. The development will consist of a network of onshore CO 2 pipelines, to be developed by GRTGaz, which will connect France’s Dunkirk industrial area to Equinor’s CO 2 Highway Europe, a large-scale CO 2 pipeline being planned by Equinor also connecting Zeebrugge, Belgium to a portfolio of storage sites under the seabed offshore Norway. The project under the PDA aims to help decarbonise the Dunkirk industrial area which accounts for around 20 percent of France’s industrial CO 2 emissions. Specifically, GRTgaz will develop a 30 km onshore pipeline network in the Dunkirk region, a compressor station in Dunkirk sending the CO 2 into the offshore pipeline connecting to the CO 2 Highway Europe. The capacity in the initial phase will be 3 to 5.5 million tonnes of CO 2 per year, and the capacity can be expanded to also accommodate CO 2 captured at other industrial clusters in France. “For industries that cannot decarbonise directly through clean power, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) offers a viable solution. By building CO 2 transport and storage solutions at an industrial scale together with GRTgaz we can help carbon-intensive industries in France to continue developing and securing jobs and value creation in a sustainable future. The collaboration also strengthens the viability of the CO 2 Highway Europe project as the French connection will further strengthen economies of scale », says Grete Tveit, senior vice president Low carbon solutions, Equinor. “GRTgaz is developing dedicated transmission networks contributing to transport CO2 from the French industrial sites where it is captured to storage and utilisation sites in France and Europe. Indeed, the capture, storage and utilisation of CO 2 will play a major role in decarbonising the national and European economy, and infrastructure is an essential element in this CO 2 value chain. We are proud to sign this partnership with Equinor and to share our respective and complementary expertise in order to provide France with an effective and competitive decarbonisation solution\", says Sandrine Meunier, chief executive officer of GRTgaz. Equinor and GRTgaz, with their complementary skills, will cooperate in the development of their CO 2 transmission and storage infrastructures and associated services: network planning, technical design and industrial safety, interoperability, regulatory aspects and institutional relations. Feasibility studies are currently under way, with the aim of launching basic engineering studies at the end of 2024 and commissioning in 2029. In",
          "The speed and scale of the energy transition must increase in order to reach the 1.5-degree ambition In 2024, almost half of the world’s population go to the polls. Many elections will demonstrate some of the key trends shaping world politics: geopolitical competition, economic nationalism, and political polarisation. This in turn will impact global energy markets and the progress of the energy transition. Energy Perspectives 2024, an independent energy scenario analysis prepared by Equinor analysts, contains two scenarios for the future of global energy markets: Walls and Bridges . Their difference highlights the contrast between the current pace of the energy transition ( Walls ) and the swift, radical changes needed to meet the 1.5°C ambition in the Paris Agreement ( Bridges ). “Despite some region’s adamant push on energy transition efforts, both through stimulus and regulation, the global development over the past few years has made the challenges of delivering on the 1.5°C ambition larger,” says Eirik Wærness, Chief economist in Equinor. Increased levels of geopolitical conflict and outright wars have made the energy transition more fragmented, and positive developments are in many cases offset by negative ones. “Despite short-term setbacks, the longer-term signals clearly point in the direction of significant energy transition and decarbonisation, but the walls have become thicker and the bridges narrower, and that adds to the uncertainty of the speed and scale of decarbonisation towards 2050 and beyond,” continues Wærness. After a few years of a tight energy supply situation, in Europe in particular, things are looking better. Energy supply security and affordability have taken the front seat, and even contributed to acceleration of transition in some sectors. Nevertheless, both industrialised and emerging economies have seen the need to prioritise differently coming out of an energy crisis while managing a higher level of geopolitical conflict. “Energy Perspectives provides important insight into the outcome space we have to consider when balancing our strategic priorities in the energy transition,” says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor. This year's report contains an updated version of the Walls scenario, while maintaining the benchmark Bridges scenario as outlined in the 2023 outlook. Energy Perspectives does not try to predict the future but shows possible future paths for the global energy system based on the choices the world makes, providing a platform for debate and informed decision-making.

          "Leading energy companies launch new Humber Hydrogen Hub projects in Parliament Leading energy companies Equinor, Centrica and SSE Thermal have launched plans for a collaboration of multiple low carbon hydrogen projects on the north bank of the Humber which also link to wider plans within the region. The plans, which include the transformation of the Easington gas terminal, were launched yesterday in the Houses of Parliament to an audience of MPs, civil servants, industry bodies and regional stakeholders. Lord Callanan, the Energy Minister responsible for Hydrogen and Carbon Capture policy, spoke at the event alongside Beverley & Holderness MP Graham Stuart and representatives from the Equinor, Centrica Energy Storage and SSE Thermal. H2H Easington includes proposals by Equinor and Centrica to deliver a multi-stage green and blue hydrogen production facility which will scale up over time as a hydrogen economy develops. Since a co-operation agreement was signed between the two companies in 2022 , detailed engineering studies have assessed projects which could produce up to 1.2GW of blue hydrogen production and up to 1GW of green hydrogen at Easington with initial projects commissioned by the end of the decade then expansion through the 2030s. To unlock these ambitions, proposals for a green hydrogen electrolyser have been submitted to Government as part of the second Hydrogen Allocation Round process. If successful, this initial electrolytic hydrogen system would be operational by early 2029 and would fuel switch off-takers within the Easington terminal, displacing current natural gas demand and significantly reducing the site’s CO2 footprint by 100,000 tonnes per year. An immediate next step would include hydrogen for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is key to facilitating the energy transition in the aviation sector. Such a transition would also safeguard many existing jobs within the historic gas terminal whilst creating new jobs and supply chain opportunities for the future. It is estimated that the 35-year economic impact of the green hydrogen proposals at Easington, including construction, operation and decommissioning of the facility, will be in the region of £1.5bn of gross value added, supporting thousands of jobs in the region. In addition to the above, the partnership will also explore a dedicated hydrogen pipeline that would link H2H Easington to Equinor’s proposed H2H Saltend hydrogen production facility at Saltend Chemicals Park, and to Equinor and SSE Thermal’s proposed hydrogen storage facility at Aldbrough on the East Yorkshire Coast. Collectively, these projects form the Humber Hydrogen Hub. Equinor and SSE Thermal are currently consulting on the proposals for hydrogen storage at the existing gas storage site near Aldbrough . The use of the geologically unique underground salt caverns for storage helps to balance the fluctuating supply and demand of a future hydrogen economy whilst",
          "improving energy security. The 45km hydrogen pipeline proposals also include a crossing of the River Humber to provide connectivity between north and south banks, whilst there is also potential for connection to the ‘Project Union’ gas network to expand across the wider Humber region. Decision makers from government departments including Energy Security & Net Zero, Business & Trade and Transport, joined the Government’s ‘Hydrogen Champion’, UK Research & Innovation and the Carbon Capture & Storage Association to listen to the new proposals. Levelling Up Minister Jacob Young MP, who is also a proactive advocate of hydrogen, was in attendance. The Humber region was represented by MPs Graham Stuart and Martin Vickers, as well as representatives from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council, Humber Chamber of Commerce and the Yorkshire & Humber CBI. Graham Stuart MP, Member of Parliament for Beverley and Holderness said: “This is an exciting collection of projects which can help to deliver on the UK’s net zero goals and hydrogen targets whilst also supporting the Government’s levelling up agenda. I’m particularly proud to have such key strategic energy sites within my constituency that are attracting investment from large companies, creating new jobs for local people and supply chain opportunities for local businesses. It shows that East Yorkshire is an internationally renowned location for low carbon technologies, and this can only help to boost prosperity across the region.” Dan Sadler, Director for Hydrogen at Equinor’s UK Low Carbon Solutions, said: “The proposals we’ve set out today demonstrate the commitment to the decarbonisation of the Humber by three of the largest players in UK energy, each with a track record of delivering ambitious schemes that reflect the changing demands of our economy. This is a unique opportunity to link these key sites in the Humber, pairing hydrogen production with users and storage sites to create the foundational requirements for an expanding hydrogen economy throughout the 2030s and 40s. It will help to reduce emissions whilst also stimulating economic growth.” Martin Scargill, Managing Director of Centrica Energy Storage, said: “These projects will bring huge benefits to the Humber as we move forward to net zero. Working together, Centrica, Equinor and SSE Thermal will deliver this innovative, world leading, regional hydrogen system, that in time could see Rough connected to provide the UK with large scale, clean energy storage. We know that the UK will need to explore all possible options to meet its net zero target and these projects will support the country’s decarbonisation plans while creating jobs and certainty for the region’s industry in the future.” John Johnson, Director of Development at SSE Thermal, said: “Hydrogen projects like the ones we’re bringing forward at Aldbrough can help to deliver",
          "a low-carbon future for the Humber. We know that all roads to net zero lead through the region and this collaboration aims to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen by linking multiple key sites and projects in support of the UK’s decarbonisation efforts. Ultimately, the Humber Hydrogen Hub can be a key enabler of a thriving hydrogen economy.”",

          "Equinor UK welcomes Aberdeen Science Centre’s collaboration with Norway’s Vitenfabrikken Aberdeen Science Centre has joined forces with Norway’s Vitenfabrikken (The Science Factory) to form the North Sea Collaboration Project. The partnership, which is also supported by Equinor, will explore the innovative carbon emissions reduction solutions being developed by Scotland and Norway. Aberdeen Science Centre and Vitenfabrikken will work together to develop a range of STEM activities and educational tools to increase awareness of the global climate crisis within schools and communities in both countries. The ‘Platforms of Tomorrow Challenge’, a competition for school pupils in Aberdeen city and shire, and in Rogoland, Norway, will task select classes of P5-P7 and S1-S3 aged children with inventing methods to reuse decommissioned oil platforms for a new and sustainable purpose. They will then present their ideas to a panel of judges using Lego models. The judges will determine the competition winner, who will receive £1,000 for a green initiative within their school or local area. The pupils behind the judge’s favourite entries will also each receive a VIP-pass to their respective local science centre. Alongside the competition, the project partners will also produce a series of educational videos, the first of which will highlight the similarities between Scotland and Norway’s energy sectors, their shared and individual climate-related challenges, and the plans that each country has in place to meet net zero targets. Arne Gürtner, senior vice president upstream at Equinor UK, said: “We are proud to work with the Aberdeen Science Centre to build excitement and new capabilities in STEM – and this partnership between the centre and Norway’s Vitenfabrikken is a great example of collaboration in action. “As we journey to net zero, encouraging an early interest in STEM subjects is vital, and exposure to new technology and innovation for young people will be crucial as we work towards a low carbon economy. “Knowledge and resource-sharing between the UK and Norway is key as we develop solutions to decarbonise. The North Sea Collaboration Project is a brilliant new alliance for Aberdeen Science Centre which puts that at its heart.”",

          "NZT Power and the Northern Endurance Partnership select contractors Net Zero Teesside Power (NZT Power) and the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) have selected contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction contracts with a combined value of around £4bn. The selection of nine leading specialist contractors across eight contract packages is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK’s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050. The final award of contracts is subject to the receipt of relevant regulatory clearances and positive Final Investment Decisions (FID) by the projects and UK government, planned for September 2024 or earlier. Following FID, the projects would be aiming for first commercial operations from 2027. The contractors announced today are: The projects represent a significant opportunity for the UK supply chain. The selected contractors will continue working with the local and regional supply chain, with further engagement taking place over the coming weeks and months. NZT Power, a joint venture between bp and Equinor, could generate up to 860 megawatts of flexible, dispatchable low-carbon power equivalent to the average electricity requirements of around 1.3 million UK homes[1]. Up to 2 million tonnes of CO2 per year would be captured at the plant, and then transported and securely stored by the NEP in subsea storage sites beneath the North Sea. NZT Power could create and support more than 3,000 construction jobs and then require around 1,000 jobs annually during operations until 2050. NEP, a joint venture between bp, Equinor, and TotalEnergies, is the CO2 transportation and storage provider for the East Coast Cluster (ECC). The Teesside onshore NEP infrastructure would serve the Teesside-based carbon capture projects – NZT Power, H2Teesside and Teesside Hydrogen CO2 Capture – that were selected for first connection to the ECC by DESNZ in March 2023 as part of the UK’s cluster sequencing process for carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS). It is anticipated that around 4 million tonnes of CO2 per year from these projects would be transported and stored from 2027. Grete Tveit, Senior Vice President at Equinor, said: “We are delighted to be taking significant steps towards the realisation of these vital decarbonisation projects through the selection of experienced contractors. It marks another major stepping stone on our route towards a final investment decision and ultimately towards a net zero East Coast Cluster.” --- [1] NZT Power’s ability to “generate dispatchable low-carbon power equivalent to the average electricity requirements of around 1.3 million UK homes” is based on average household consumption data from BEIS, ‘Subnational Electricity and Gas Consumption Statistics’, 22 December 2020 and total UK households equalling 27.8m, as stated in the Families and households in the UK: 2020 report published by the Office",

          "Equinor’s second quarter 2024 safety results Equinor’s long-term safety trend continues to move in a positive direction. The total number of serious incidents and injuries per million hours worked has never been lower than at the end of the second quarter, measured over the previous twelve months. “It’s encouraging to see that systematic efforts over time produce good results. Our employees and suppliers work hard every day to share lessons learned and improve safety work,” says Jannicke Nilsson, Equinor’s executive vice president for safety, security and sustainability. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, the serious incident frequency per million hours worked (SIF) was 0.3, down from 0.4 for the first quarter. Serious personal injuries are also included in the serious incident statistics. The personal injury frequency per million hours worked (TRIF) as of the second quarter is 2.2 for the last 12 months, down from 2.3 at the end of the first quarter. Equinor continues to pursue work to prevent major accidents through extra focus on management training and annual e-learning refresher courses that are also available to the company’s suppliers. Equinor has seen marked improvement as regards safety within drilling and wells in recent years. By building a strong culture and applying a systematic approach, we have worked with our suppliers and thus raised the safety standard for an entire industry. “This is a good example of long-term, systematic work. Collaboration, dialogue and sharing a common objective with our suppliers have been key factors in this improvement,” says Nilsson. A total of nine oil and gas leaks have been recorded over the last 12 months. Oil and gas leaks are classified according to the severity of the leak rate. There have been no incidents with major accident potential or serious well control incidents in the second quarter. Through the “Always Safe” annual wheel, Equinor works with other operating companies and suppliers to improve understanding of which factors can get in the way of safe work performance. The focus for the third quarter of this year is on falling objects. Investigation following the helicopter accident Equinor’s internal investigation following the helicopter accident on 28 February was presented in June. The internal investigation has assessed helicopter safety within search and rescue (SAR) as well as how emergencies are handled. The incident is considered to have had a major accident potential. See press release with link to the investigation report See press release with link to the investigation report The Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority is investigating the course of events and the causal factors that led to the accident. The police are also investigating the accident. The results from these efforts will be available at a later date. Equinor",
          "Equinor signs UK Armed Forces Covenant Equinor has signed the UK Armed Forces Covenant, which is a voluntary pledge to support the welfare, employment and professional development of the armed forces community and their families. Following the signing of the pledge on Tuesday 2 July at the Ministry of Defence, Equinor joins more than 10,000 organisations across a range of sectors that have committed themselves to providing fair treatment for veterans, serving personnel, reservists and their families. There are several transferable skills between the armed forces and the energy sector, particularly in the oil and gas and offshore wind industries. This is something which Equinor recognises, and the company employs a number of ex-services personnel. Currently around 50% of Equinor’s staff on the Service Operation Vessels (SOVs) for the Dudgeon and Sheringham Shoal windfarms are ex-armed forces. The signing of the covenant will ensure that Equinor continues to support these employees, as well as members of the reserve forces, those who work with cadets, and those who have spouses, partners or families in the military. It will also ensure that these groups have fair access to employment at Equinor. Equinor has developed initiatives which will help people as they transition from the military, including supporting professional development. As a company, Equinor is committed to flexible working, and this will be enhanced for members of the reserves so they can meet their commitments for training. Equinor will also attend career events to ensure veterans are aware of existing opportunities in the sector. UK Country Manager, Alex Grant, signed the Armed Forces Covenant at the Ministry of Defence. Speaking about signing the pledge he said: “I was immensely proud to sign the Armed Forces Covenant on behalf of Equinor UK. This formalises our commitment to providing employment opportunities to veterans, and I am sure this will have a positive impact on our current and future workforce. “At Equinor, we are committed to building a diverse workforce and supporting employment in the communities we work in. We want to enable all our employees to meet their full potential, and make sure that we attract and retain the best talent to the business, and initiatives such as the Armed Forces Covenant are vital to ensuring we do this.” Scott Larke is a senior analyst for operations and maintenance in Equinor’s renewables business, who joined Equinor after spending 25 years in the Royal Air Force. He joined the forces when he finished school and held the role of Sergeant in the engineering fleet planning team for the Tornados before he joined Equinor 13 years ago to work on its Sheringham Shoal offshore wind development. Speaking about the Armed Forces Covenant, he said: “I am very",

The investigation aims to ensure that lessons are learned from the accident, and to identify actions and measures aimed at improving the company’s SAR service and accident preparedness. This serious helicopter accident caused one Equinor employee to lose their life, while five Bristow employees were injured. The helicopter type was Sikorsky S-92 Search and Rescue (SAR), and it was engaged in a training exercise for Equinor when the accident occurred. The Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority (NSIA) is responsible for mapping the course of events and the actual cause of the accident. In March, Equinor decided to conduct an internal investigation to capture its own lessons to be learned. The investigation has been performed by an independent investigation group led by Equinor Corporate Audit & Investigation. “It’s important that we examine this in depth to make sure we learn from this serious accident. The investigation has uncovered findings and points to specific improvement items that we will follow up to further strengthen Equinor’s SAR service and accident preparedness,” says CEO Anders Opedal. The investigation report recommends measures within training and drills, protective equipment and coordinated action within the organisation as regards Equinor’s SAR service and accident preparedness. An additional recommendation is to conduct a new assessment of whether the measures implemented after the Turøy accident have had the expected long-term effect. The investigation group makes it clear that the recommended actions",

          "Equinor’s first quarter 2024 safety results Bristow and Equinor were stricken by a tragic helicopter accident in the first quarter. At the same time the safety statistics indicate a long-term positive trend in general for the period. “On 28 February we lost a good colleague when an Oseberg search and rescue (SAR) helicopter crashed off Sotra by Bergen. The accident has strongly affected everyone involved and colleagues across the company. It is a strong reminder of the importance of the safety work being undertaken in all our activities,” says Jannicke Nilsson, Equinor’s executive vice president for safety, security, and sustainability. One Equinor employee died in the accident. The five other people on board the helicopter survived. They worked for Bristow on assignment for Equinor.

          "Mourning colleague lost in helicopter accident On 1 March, Norwegian police confirmed the identity of Reidun Hestetun (61), resident in Bergen, who lost her life in the helicopter accident offshore on February 28. “Our thoughts are first and foremost with the family and friends who have lost their beloved Reidun in this tragic accident. In Equinor, we mourn the loss of a close and dear colleague. We extend our deepest condolences to family and friends during this difficult time,\" says Equinor's chief executive officer Anders Opedal. Reidun Hestetun is described by her close colleagues as a highly skilled and reliable SAR nurse with high personal integrity, she was humble, caring, and tough at the same time. Colleagues point out that Reidun always took time to help others when they needed it. She was someone who people listened to, and someone who many felt they could confide in. Reidun Hestetun worked as a SAR nurse and was on board the SAR helicopter that crashed. The accident happened on Wednesday evening 28 February while the helicopter, which was part of the SAR service for the Oseberg area in the North Sea, was on a training assignment for Equinor. Hestetun was a trained nurse anesthetist specialized in search and rescue. She joined Equinor in 2002. She has previously worked as a nurse on the Grane and Troll C installations. From 2009 she worked as an HSE coordinator and SAR nurse at the Oseberg field centre. Reidun leaves behind her partner, daughter, son in law and two grandchildren.

          "Resuming helicopter flights on the NCS In consultation with the Civil Aviation Authority, Equinor has decided to resume flights with Sikorsky S-92 helicopters to the offshore installations on the NCS. After the tragic helicopter accident on February 28, the major operators on the NCS decided to suspend all flights to and from installations offshore in order to ensure complete understanding of the situation. Equinor has used the time to take care of relatives, review the situation, and make the necessary clarifications with the authorities and flight safety specialists to ensure that the flights can be resumed safely. The search and rescue service (SAR) has been operational throughout the period. “This serious incident affects us all. Flight safety and the safety of everyone travelling by helicopter is fundamental to our operations. Based on dialogue with the Civil Aviation Authority, there are no indications that helicopter safety on the NCS is reduced,” says Kjetil Hove, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. A decision to resume flights requires coordination between the aviation authorities, helicopter operators, trade unions, and NCS operating companies. Based on this work, all the companies, coordinated through Offshore Norge, have decided to resume their flights. “The unions and safety delegates are satisfied with the information we have received during the process. We thought it was right that flights were paused after the accident. When the authorities and other professional communities say that it is safe to start ordinary transport services, we must have great confidence in them and the decisions that have been made,” says Baste Daltveit, coordinating head safety delegate for Equinor on the Norwegian continental shelf on behalf of unions and the safety delegates.

          "Equinor continues to capture value from offshore wind, farming down 10 % in Dogger Bank A and B Eni has also entered into an agreement to purchase a 10% interest in Dogger Bank A and B from project partner SSE on the same terms. Once the transaction is complete, the new overall shareholding in Dogger Bank A (1.2 GW) and Dogger Bank B (1.2 GW) will be – SSE (40%), Equinor (40%) and Eni (20%). Eni will enter the assets effective from financial close of project financing which was reached on 25 November. The consideration of around GBP 202.5 million reflects the payment to Equinor for a 10% equity interest in both Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B. Equinor’s shareholder loan financing to date of around GBP 185 million was repaid following the financial close. “This is our third offshore wind transaction in less than two years. Once again, we have demonstrated Equinor’s ability to create value from renewables projects. The divestment is in line with our strategy. We access attractive acreage early and at scale, then leverage our technology and experience to mature and de-risk projects. Today’s deal underpins our track record in consistently capturing value from world class assets,” says Pål Eitrheim, executive vice president in New Energy Solutions in Equinor. Equinor and SSE Renewables secured 3.6 GW of offshore wind contracts for Dogger Bank’s three phases, Dogger Bank A, Dogger Bank B and Dogger Bank C in the UK Government’s 2019 Contract for Difference auctions. The first two phases of Dogger Bank reached recently financial close at competitive terms, underlining the attractiveness of the UK offshore wind assets and the confidence in the joint venture. Dogger Bank C is being developed on a different timescale with financial close to follow at a later stage. There is no change to the ownership of the third phase, Dogger Bank C (1.2 GW), in which Equinor and SSE each have a 50% stake. SSE Renewables are leading the construction of the 3.6 GW project, and Equinor will lead on the wind farm’s operations. “Dogger Bank is the largest wind farm in the world under construction, and we are pleased to welcome Eni as a new partner. Through the sheer scale of the project we have delivered record-low contract prices for the UK market, and as operator of the wind farm we will continue to deliver value to the UK for years to come. Together with our partners we will continue to drive the energy transition to a net zero emissions future for the UK,” says Eitrheim. “For Eni, entering the offshore wind market in Northern Europe is a great opportunity to gain further skills in the sector thanks to",

The companies will collaborate on projects that can provide good value creation and help Equinor's transition into becoming a broad energy company. \"Equinor and SINTEF have a long history together, but we must continue to look ahead. With this agreement, we can quickly achieve results in areas that are important for the energy transition\", says Sophie Hildebrand, senior vice president of Research and Technology at Equinor. One of the areas of collaboration is already well underway: offshore wind – particularly floating wind. Equinor has already built the world's first floating wind farm, Hywind Scotland, and is in the process of building Norway's first floating farm, Hywind Tampen. The offshore wind collaboration between Equinor and SINTEF dates back to the first test of the Hywind technology in SINTEF's Ocean Basin Laboratory, in 2005. Looking forward, it will enable the development of technology that will make future projects cheaper, more efficient and more predictable. Among other things, the two partners will look at anchoring systems for the turbines, maintenance, control systems and grid connection. In addition to improving the Hywind concept, the two partners will also examine other concepts for floating wind. \"This agreement is about more than just a collaboration within Norway's borders. It is about strengthening our global position in areas where Norway has a strong natural and technological advantage. Norway is an energy and maritime nation and could become one of the biggest players within sustainable energy from the ocean\", says Alexandra Bech Gjørv, president and CEO of SINTEF. In addition to offshore wind, the other collaboration areas are: Marine systems, which encompasses the challenges related to marine structures, anchoring, risers and underwater pipelines, underwater technology, underwater robotics, safety and the environment. Energy systems in connection with the development of renewable energy, including storage methods for renewable energy. Modelling, i.e. all sort of modelling studies related to the three other topics.

          "Equinor and partner reach financial close on world's biggest offshore wind farm “Reaching financial close on the two first phases of Dogger Bank is a major milestone, demonstrating our commitment to profitable growth within offshore wind. The extensive interest from lenders underpins the attractiveness of UK offshore wind assets and confidence in SSE and Equinor. As the wind farm’s future operator, we are proud to take this big step forward in delivering what will be the backbone of a growing wind hub in the North Sea,” says Pål Eitrheim, Equinor’s executive vice president of New Energy Solutions. The total senior debt facilities across the two phases is GBP 4.8 billion, plus ancillary facilities of around GBP 0.7 billion. Dogger Bank A and B are being project financed with gearing of 65% to 70% for the generation assets. Gearing on the transmission facilities is set to 90% of the forecasted OFTO sale proceeds. With the strong interest from lenders, Dogger Bank A and B were able to secure competitive terms, despite unprecedented economic circumstances arising from the global coronavirus pandemic. The final group of lenders, comprising 29 banks and three export credit agencies, includes experienced lenders in the sector along with relationship lenders of both SSE and Equinor. The level of interest achieved reflects the quality of the project and enables strong returns on shareholder capital to be delivered. “Equinor is committed to being a leading company in the energy transition and to helping the UK Government deliver on its 10-point plan for a green industrial future. Through the sheer scale of the project we have delivered record-low contract prices for the UK market, and as operator of the wind farm we will continue to deliver value to the UK for years to come. Dogger Bank will generate renewable electricity for British homes, whilst creating jobs and attracting significant investment to the UK,” says Eitrheim. The project is being built in three 1.2 GW phases, with the first two phases being constructed at the same time to take advantage of the synergies resulting from their geographical proximity and use of common technology and contractors. As such, the two phases are being financed concurrently with all lenders participating in each phase in equal proportions. Dogger Bank A and B will each require total capital expenditure of around GBP 3 billion, including the capex for the offshore transmission station (OFTO). The third phase, Dogger Bank C, is being developed on a different timescale with financial close to follow at a later stage. SSE Renewables are leading the construction of the 3.6 GW project, and Equinor will lead on the wind farm’s operations. Equinor is developing as a broad energy company, and on 2",

          "Construction starts on the world's largest floating offshore wind farm Prime Minister Solberg and Linga started the cutting robot on the project's first sheet of steel on Thursday, 1 October. Kværner’s assignment will include building 11 floating concrete hulls for the turbines on Hywind Tampen. \"Hywind Tampen is a new chapter in Norway’s narrative as an energy nation. With support from the Norwegian authorities, we're not only building Norway’s first offshore wind project; we're refining floating offshore wind technology along with the Norwegian supplier industry,\" says Equinor president and CEO Eldar Sætre. \"Eighty percent of the world's offshore wind resources are located in deep water areas and are available for floating offshore wind projects. If we can use projects like Hywind Tampen to make floating offshore wind competitive with other forms of energy, the technology will be able to deliver large-scale renewable power and contribute to a more sustainable global energy supply. A floating offshore wind market will also open up considerable industrial opportunities for Norwegian industry,\" Sætre says. The development of the Hywind Tampen project involves around 250 full-time equivalents for Kværner employees. Kværner's project will also generate around 800 full-time equivalents in ripple effects for suppliers and the public sector, among others. A study conducted by Multiconsult shows that, in total, the Hywind Tampen project could provide 1,550 to 3,000 full-time equivalents in ripple effects for the Norwegian private sector. Equinor's ambition is for floating offshore wind to be competitive with other forms of energy by 2030. \"By using larger turbines, concrete substructures, new technology and a new assembly method, we're well on our way toward delivering on the objective to reduce costs by more than 40% compared with Hywind Scotland. This is an important step to establish floating wind as a sustainable power supply alternative,\" says Hywind Tampen project director Olav-Bernt Haga. \"If more major floating offshore wind projects are realised in the future, it will be possible to reduce costs even further, and we could see a development in cost reductions equivalent to the one we've seen in fixed foundation offshore wind,\" Haga says. Equinor sees a potential for floating offshore wind projects in Norway, the UK, Europe, the US and Asia. The Hywind Tampen project will be the first floating offshore wind project to supply renewable power for oil and gas installations. The wind farm will have a total capacity of 88 MW, and is expected to cover about 35 percent of the annual electrical power needs on the five platforms Snorre A and B and Gullfaks A, B and C. Hywind Tampen will reduce emissions from the Gullfaks and Snorre fields by more than 200,000 tonnes per year, which corresponds to annual emissions from",
          "100,000 private vehicles. Equinor has been a pioneer in floating offshore wind technology and has been working on this technology for nearly 20 years.

          "Improving recovery from Statfjord Øst Written notification of material changes to the Plan for Development and Operation Statfjord Øst was submitted to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy 16.12.2020. “The decision to improve recovery on Statfjord Øst will add considerable value to society and owners and will create positive effects for suppliers. Our ambition is to maintain safe and profitable production and secure valuable activity from the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) for several decades,” says Kjetil Hove, Equinor’s senior vice president for Field Life eXtension (FLX). Statfjord Øst is tied back to the Statfjord C platform by pipelines. A total of four new wells will be drilled from existing subsea templates. The project also includes modifications on Statfjord C and a new pipeline for gas lift. “We will be a leading late life operator on the NCS. In order to achieve this, we must work in new ways to reduce costs, thereby offering new opportunities for investments in late life fields ensuring profitable reservoir management. The Statfjord Øst decision is a good example of this,” says Hove. This decision enables an improvement of the recovery factor on Statfjord Øst and gives an important contribution to extending the life of the Statfjord C platform and the Statfjord Øst field towards 2040. The original oil volume in place on Statfjord Øst was 415 million barrels of oil. The current recovery factor is 56 percent. As a result of this project, the expected recovery factor is increased to 62 percent. Plans call for installation of a pipeline for gas lift, modifications on Statfjord C and drilling of new wells in 2022 - 2024. Production start is scheduled for 2024. The Statfjord Øst development comprises subsea installations that include three templates. The field is located five kilometres north-east of Statfjord C. The field came on stream in 1994. The licence partners in Statfjord Øst Unit: Equinor Energy AS (31.6875%), Petoro AS (30.0000%), Vår Energi AS (20.5500%), Spirit Energy Norway AS (11.5625%), Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS (4.8000%), Wintershall Dea Norge AS (1.4000%). After several extensions of the Statfjord field life, the current goal is to maintain safe and profitable operation until 2040. Statfjord is part of FLX, which was established to meet the strategic opportunities and challenges of late life fields in relation to Equinor’s competitiveness. FLX aims to ensure that Equinor is the leading company in safe and efficient operations with low carbon emissions from late life fields on the NCS.",
          "Aker Solutions awarded new Johan Sverdrup contract Johan Sverdrup phase 2 includes a new processing platform currently under construction by Aibel. After the assembly in sheltered waters in 2021, it will be towed back to Haugesund for completion before installation on the field in the spring of 2022. The new contract awarded to Aker Solutions covers hook-up on the field and other hook-up and completion tasks that must be carried out after the platform has been installed to prepare it for operation. It will be connected to the existing field installations by a gangway to the existing riser platform. Aker Solutions was awarded a similar contract in the first phase of the Johan Sverdrup development. “Now Aker Solutions is modifying the riser platform for phase 2 and can move on to the hook-up and completion of the new processing platform on the field in 2022,” says Bjarne Bakken, project director for Johan Sverdrup phase 2. Planning of the work will start immediately. At peak in 2022 the project will employ around 1,200 people distributed on three offshore shifts of 400 people each, in addition to an onshore organization of around 100 people. Production start for Johan Sverdrup phase 2 is planned in the fourth quarter of 2022. “Johan Sverdrup phase 2 will provide high value creation with record-low emissions. The project generates activity and spinoffs in Norway. More than 90 percent of the project contracts have been awarded to Norwegian suppliers. The contracts have been awarded in strong international competition, proving the competitiveness of the Norwegian supplier industry,” says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. Licence owners: Equinor Energy AS: 42.6267% (operator), Lundin Energy Norway AS: 20%, Petoro AS 17.36%, Aker BP ASA: 11.5733% and Total E&P Norge AS: 8.44%.",
          "Snorre Expansion Project now in production The project was originally scheduled to come on stream in the first quarter of 2021. The Snorre field partnership consists of Equinor, Petoro, Vår Energi, Idemitsu and Wintershall Dea. “I am proud that we have managed to achieve safe start-up of the Snorre Expansion Project ahead of schedule in such a challenging year as 2020. In addition, the project is set to be delivered more than NOK 1 billion below the cost estimate in the plan for development and operation (PDO),” says Geir Tungesvik, Equinor’s executive vice president for Technology, Projects and Drilling. The Snorre field has been on stream since 1992. There are substantial resources left in the ground on the Snorre field. In December 2017, Equinor and the Snorre partners submitted a modified plan for development and operation (PDO) for the Snorre field to Norwegian authorities. The recovery factor will now be increased from 46 to 51 percent, representing significant value for a field with 2 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves. The Hywind Tampen project, featuring 11 floating wind turbines that will supply the Snorre and Gullfaks fields with power, is expected to come on stream in the third quarter of 2022. Some 35 percent of the electrical power requirement for the two fields is expected to be met using wind power. According to the original PDO, the Snorre field was intended to be closed in 2011-2014, but continues to produce thanks to the authorities’ consent to extend the field’s life. “Life extension represents good resource management. The new volumes brought to Snorre A help ensure activity offshore and onshore, creating substantial value for the Norwegian society,” says Arne Sigve Nylund, Equinor’s executive vice president for Development and Production Norway. The investments in Snorre Expansion Project total NOK 19.5 billion (2020 value), and the development is profitable even at far lower oil prices than today. The project has had substantial spin-off effects for the supply industry in Norway, particularly in Eastern Norway and in Rogaland. 24 new wells will be drilled to recover the new volumes. The wells are divided into six subsea templates. Bundles connecting the new wells to the platform have also been installed, in addition to new risers. The project also includes a new module and modifications on Snorre A. After three years of modifications being carried out on a platform on stream, the final preparations to receive oil from the new wells were performed during a major turnaround this autumn. The turnaround and work were performed without injuries or serious incidents. Although the Snorre Expansion Project had progressed far when the Covid-19 pandemic began, the project has experienced challenges associated with deliveries, closed borders and plants, in",
          "addition to limited workforce on the platform due to infection control measures. 2020 has been a busy year, particularly when it comes to marine operations and modifications. Despite this, production began ahead of schedule. “This is a result of excellent teamwork, both internally with own employees and safety delegates, and with our suppliers and partners. In a very unusual year many have gone to great lengths, been constructive and solution-oriented to ensure that the project was delivered,” says Tungesvik. The Snorre field partnership consists of: Equinor Energy AS (operator) 33.27 %, Petoro AS 30%, Vår Energi AS 18.55%, Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS 9.6 % and Wintershall Dea Norge AS 8.57%.",
          "Equinor acquires interests in conventional onshore assets in Russia Through this agreement Equinor has acquired a 49% interest in the limited liability company LLC KrasGeoNaC (KGN) which holds twelve conventional onshore exploration and production licenses in Eastern Siberia. The payment at completion of the transaction is around USD 550 million, which includes a cash consideration of USD 325 million at the effective date of 1 January 2019, and customary adjustments. As part of this agreement, Equinor has redirected its remaining exploration commitments offshore in the Sea of Okhotsk and as such has no outstanding obligations in that area. One of these twelve licenses, the North Danilovsky development, started production in July this year. Production is expected to reach 40,000 barrels of oil per day by 2024, with subsequent plans to increase this to 70,000 barrels of oil per day. Pursuant to the 2018 agreement between Equinor and Rosneft to cooperate on health, safety and sustainability, Equinor will collaborate with Rosneft in these areas across the KGN assets.",
          "Equinor awarding contracts for supply vessels The total framework includes options and costs related to Havila Charisma modifications. “We have received safe and efficient deliveries from Havila Shipping for several years and look forward to continuing our cooperation with the shipping company. Long-term contracts bring predictability to both Equinor and our suppliers, and form the basis of continuous improvement,” says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. The vessels are part of a fleet of supply vessels supporting Equinor’s operations on the entire Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Havila Charisma will also be modified to support seismic services in the form of permanent reservoir monitoring. This includes increased accommodation capacity. The vessel’s capacities for supply duties will remain unchanged. Havila Charisma will sail from the supply base in Florø when it is not on seismic assignments. “The supply vessels along the entire Norwegian coast are the vital nerve of the more than 40 fields we operate on the NCS. By modifying Havila Charisma to provide seismic services in addition to supply services, we are utilizing our scale advantage to achieve higher efficiency and flexibility in our operations,” says Morten Sundt, who is leading Equinor’s supply vessel activities on the NCS. Havila Foresight has its home base at Equinor’s supply base at Mongstad. With the new contract Havila Foresight will have supplied Equinor’s installations from Mongstad for 15 years. Both vessels have previously been fitted with a battery and adapted for shore power, which increases safety and reduces CO 2 emissions. All vessels on longer-term contracts for Equinor (approx. 20 vessels) have, or will have, a battery and a shore-power system within 2021. The two Havila vessels are among the most fuel-efficient vessels in Equinor’s fleet of supply vessels. Previously the vessels have been modified to ensure safer operations on board, such as heightened cargo rail on Havila Foresight’s loading deck.",
          "New helicopter contract for Stavanger The contract will run from 1 July 2021 for a fixed period of three years and includes three yearly options. The total value of the contract with options is estimated at NOK 1 billion. The contract covers crew change services with two Sikorsky S-92 helicopters, with a possibility to increase with one additional helicopter. In connection with this procurement, Equinor and Vår Energi have entered into a cooperation agreement and will share capacity on one of the helicopters. “We have good experience of cooperation with Vår Energi on joint procurement of helicopter services. The cooperation contributes to efficient use of helicopter capacity and increases flexibility for both companies. It also allows for better long-term planning from the service provider”, says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. For Equinor, the helicopters will be used in connection with crew change services in the southern part of the North Sea, serving the fields Johan Sverdrup, Gina Krog, Sleipner, Grane, Gudrun, Heimdal and Draupner, as well as drilling rigs in the area. “Stavanger airport, Sola, is a cornerstone for our operations in the North Sea. About 50,000 passengers are annually transported from Sola to Equinor’s offshore installations and back. We look forward to cooperate with CHC and Vår Energi to deliver safe and efficient personnel transportation from Sola airport”, says Steinar Mathisen, responsible for aviation on the NCS for Equinor.",
          "Internal investigation of oil seepage to the ground at Mongstad “As soon as we became aware of the situation, Equinor quickly implemented measures to limit the consequences of the oil seepage. The oil in the ground around the overflow basin has now been collected. All identified sources of leakages have been fixed, and oil values from the water treatment plant have returned to normal levels,” says Irene Rummelhoff, executive vice president of Marketing, Midstream and Processing at Equinor. The overflow basin is the final stage in the treatment plant at Mongstad. The basin collects treated water before it is ‘released’ into Fensfjorden in accordance with the permit granted by the authorities. Following a requirement from the Norwegian Environment Agency, a new water volume meter was installed in early 2019 at the outlet of the overflow basin. After this installation, daily analyses revealed increased presence of hydrocarbons in the overflow basins. Equinor’s investigations in spring 2020 determined that the direct cause was increased seepage from already polluted ground. Installation of the new water flow metre led to higher groundwater levels in periods with a lot of precipitation, so that the stabile oil that was in the ground was washed out and had run down into the overflow basin. The measures that were initiated have been effective, and the oily water values from the overflow basin have now returned to normal. The Norwegian Environment Agency was notified in February, at which time Equinor also initiated an internal investigation. The investigation report reveals that the oil seepage cannot be tied to a particular incident, but is rather due to seepage from the drainage system for oily water, as well as several minor, past discharges from operations and maintenance routines and incidents. A total of 112 cubic metres of oil have been collected and removed from the area. Based on the information from Equinor, the Norwegian Environment Agency issued an order on 27 November, requiring Equinor to undertake a thorough assessment of the pollution situation in the ground, as well as to implement measures to prevent negative environmental impact from potential ground pollution. “The conditions we uncovered at Mongstad are unacceptable. The investigation shows an inadequate understanding of requirements that apply for discharges to the ground. This has led to us developing a practice in this area that does not conform with relevant environmental requirements. In addition to operative measures on site, we have therefore commenced work to improve knowledge and ensure compliance with all requirements for discharges to the ground. As regards discharges to water, the investigation confirms that we have good routines in place to ensure that we are within the limits set by the authorities,” says Irene Rummelhoff.",
          "Increasing capacity on Johan Sverdrup to half a million barrels of oil per day Equinor and its partners have tested the plant capacity in November to verify a possible production rise. As the test results have been very positive a production increase is called for by the end of 2020. By then the production capacity will rise from today’s 470,000 to around 500,000 barrels of oil per day. The Johan Sverdrup field has had safe and stable operation since it came on stream just over a year ago. “For the second time since the start-up the plant is able to increase its daily capacity. As Johan Sverdrup is a field with high profitability and low CO 2 emissions, a production rise is great news. The field has low operating costs, providing revenue for the companies and Norwegian society, even in periods with low prices,” says Jez Averty, senior vice president for operations south in Development and Production Norway. The Johan Sverdrup field is powered from shore with very low CO 2 emissions per barrel. Emissions during the field life are estimated at less than 0.7kg CO 2 per produced barrel. Phase 2 of the Johan Sverdrup field development is on schedule, and production start is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase means that the Johan Sverdrup full-field plateau production capacity is expected to rise from 690,000 to around 720,000 barrels of oil per day. The Johan Sverdrup field is using water injection to secure high recovery of reserves and maintain production at a high level. “Based on the positive results of the capacity test where we produced at rates of over 500,000 barrels of oil per day, we are now working on solutions to increase the water injection capacity which should allow us to further increase daily production capacity beyond this level by mid-2021,” says Rune Nedregaard, vice president for Johan Sverdrup operations. PARTNERS: Equinor: 42.6% (operator), Lundin Energy Norway: 20%, Petoro: 17.36%, Aker BP: 11.5733% and Total: 8.44%.",
          "Awarding study contracts for Wisting “Wisting is a considerable oil field in the Barents Sea, and we are cooperating well with our partners in further maturing the project. Founded on experience and synergy potential within the project-portfolio we have assessed different development alternatives to identify potential solutions for a cost-effective and optimal field development” says Trond Bokn, acting senior vice president for project development in Equinor. “Based on this work, the licence partners have decided to further assess a floating production unit based on a circular FPSO solution (floating production, storage and offloading). However, a lot of work remains before we can make a final concept select during second quarter of 2021,” says Bokn. Equinor and the industry have ambitious plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from activities on the Norwegian continental shelf. The Wisting partners are focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the production to the lowest extent feasible. “Electrification is considered a possible option for reducing field emissions. The project will study a power-from-shore solution for a circular FPSO going forward,” says Bokn. In 2019, the authorities approved a transfer of the Wisting operatorship to Equinor in the development phase, while OMV will resume operatorship in the production phase. Equinor is leading the development project and personnel from OMV is well integrated in the project organisation. Suppliers who have been awarded contracts in connection with the start of Wisting concept studies: FPSO: Aker Solutions, KBR Ltd., Sevan SSP and Aibel SURF (Subsea Production and Processing Equipment, Umbilical, Risers and Flowlines): Aker Solutions, TechnipFMC, OneSubsea Processing, IKM Ocean Design and Kongsberg Maritime FPSO: Aker Solutions, KBR Ltd., Sevan SSP and Aibel SURF (Subsea Production and Processing Equipment, Umbilical, Risers and Flowlines): Aker Solutions, TechnipFMC, OneSubsea Processing, IKM Ocean Design and Kongsberg Maritime An investment decision for Wisting is planned at the end of 2022. Partners: Equinor (35%), OMV (Norge) AS (25%), Petoro AS (20%) and Idemitsu Petroleum Norge AS (20%).",
          "Contracts for services at seven supply bases in Norway “Employing over 800 people, from Dusavik in the South to Hammerfest in the North, the bases create important activity in the local communities along the Norwegian coast. The new two-year contracts help secure jobs and enable continuity for the bases and the business clusters associated with them,” says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. The three suppliers have been delivering safe and efficient operations at the supply bases since 2015. The new contracts are awarded through an exercise of options included in the framework agreements established in 2015. The contracts will start up on 1 July 2021 and have a duration of two years. The total value of the contracts is estimated at about NOK 1.4 billion. The scope includes terminal and warehouse services. “The supply bases in Norway are cornerstones for our offshore operations all along the coast. In 2019, around two million tons of goods and bulk were shipped via these bases to serve our offshore operations. We look forward to further cooperate and improve together with our supply base service suppliers on safety, efficiency and sustainability,” says Roger Foss, manager supply operations for Equinor on the Norwegian continental shelf. Equinor cooperates with these and other suppliers at the bases to reduce CO 2 emissions from logistical operations on the Norwegian continental shelf. A recent example is the common effort to enable shore-to-ship power supply, now in place at five of the bases. This significantly reduces both CO 2 emissions and noise from vessels while docked at the bases.",
          "Awarding Bacalhau drilling and well services contracts The total value of the three contracts is estimated at USD 455 million. The contracts have a firm period of 4 years and two 2-year options. “The awards build further on our positive cooperation experience with the three selected suppliers in our projects worldwide. They will be essential to ensure safe and efficient drilling and well operations on the Bacalhau field,” says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. The contract scope awarded to Baker Hughes covers drilling services and completion. Halliburton’s scope of work will include intervention services and liner hanger, while Schlumberger will deliver wireline services. The awards are expected to make a significant contribution to local content in Brazil. The average local content of the three contracts, considering the majority of services will be performed in Brazil, is estimated at 74%. “Brazil is a core area for Equinor, and Bacalhau is an important asset in the Brazilian pre-salt Santos area. Together with our partners, we are currently maturing the project towards a final investment decision (FID) which is planned in 2021,” says Trond Bokn, acting senior vice president for project development in Equinor. Earlier this year, the partnership entered into front end engineering and design (FEED) contracts with early commitments and pre-investments for the Bacalhau field with MODEC for FPSO and Subsea Integration Alliance (SIA) for SURF. The awards have an option for the execution phase under a lump sum turnkey contract setup which includes engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) for the entire SURF and FPSO scopes. Partners in Bacalhau: Equinor 40 % (operator), ExxonMobil 40 %, Petrogal Brasil 20 % and Pré-sal Petróleo SA (PPSA, non-investor Government Agency).",
          "Oil discoveries offshore Newfoundland, Canada The two wells at the Cappahayden and Cambriol prospects, drilled this summer in the Flemish Pass Basin, have proven the presence of hydrocarbons; however, it is too early to provide specific information on volumes. \"We are pleased to have made two discoveries offshore Newfoundland. The results are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team, who have executed a safe campaign with positive results – particularly considering the unique challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Paul McCafferty, Equinor’s senior vice president for international offshore exploration. The wells, drilled by the semi-submersible drilling rig, Transocean Barents, are located approximately 500 kms east of St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador. The Cappahayden well has a water depth of about 1,000 metres and the Cambriol well has a depth of 600 metres. Equinor was the operator for the wells.

          "2021. In March Martin Linge had to demobilize all personnel due to Covid-19, and later remobilized with a limited workforce in accordance with new infection control measures. Since last year the cost estimate has increased by NOK 3.6 billion. Half of this is estimated to be due to Covid-19 infection control measures. Add to this increased scope of work on the platform and the drilling of up to three new wells, as reported by Equinor earlier this autumn. Exclusive of currency effects the cost estimates for Johan Castberg have declined by NOK 1.5 billion since the PDO. Due to an estimated currency loss of about NOK 4.4 billion the project will still see a total cost increase of NOK 2.8 billion since the PDO was approved in 2018. Since last year costs have increased by a total of NOK 3.4 billion. The increased costs related to Covid-19 account for about NOK 2.5 billion of this. The delivery of the FPSO hull is delayed by one year. The yard in Singapore has been fully shut down and still has a sharply reduced workforce. Work to repair welds on the hull is underway. Johan Castberg is still a project with good profitability. The scheduled production start is postponed until 4th quarter 2023. The investment estimate for the project has increased by NOK 8.5 billion, an increase of 53 percent since the PDO in 2017. The increase is largely due to the work on the Njord A platform’s life extension being more extensive than expected, and the increased scope of the Njord Bravo upgrading and tie-in work. Since last year the investment estimate has increased by almost NOK 4 billion. About half of this is associated with delays in connection with Covid-19 measures and extended project execution period. The Njord Future project will recover expected remaining resources totalling 175 million barrels of oil equivalent on the Njord and Hyme fields. This corresponds to the reserves produced on the Njord field since start-up in 1997. The upgrading of the Njord A platform takes place at Kværner Stord, whereas the Njord Bravo floating storage and offloading vessel is being upgraded at the Aibel’s yard in Haugesund. Planned start-up is delayed to 2021.",

The contract is estimated to create 200 man-years in Norway connected to the rig, and an additional 20-40 man-years related to support functions. “We have had excellent cooperation with Odfjell over time, and they have consistently delivered wells safely and efficiently to us by use of the Deepsea Atlantic drilling rig. This time a sister rig with the same technical design will be used and we have high expectations to Deepsea Aberdeen as well. Through this agreement we are enhancing our cooperation with Odfjell based on our good experience with the company, and it will be exciting to develop this further,” says Erik G. Kirkemo, senior vice president of drilling & well operations in Equinor. Deepsea Aberdeen is a semi-submersible 6th generation rig with a dual derrick. “In this contract we have further developed the performance-based compensation system, enabling the supplier to increase their profit per well delivery by completing safe and efficient operations. We regard this as an important step towards reaching our ambition of shifting focus from rate per day to cost per well, a move we believe is important to ensure sustainable costs in the future,” says Equinor’s chief procurement officer Peggy Krantz-Underland. At the end of September, Equinor and its partners submitted the PDO for Breidablikk. Several contracts have been awarded and Norwegian companies are expected to account for around 70% of the value creation in the development phase. Estimated field recovery is around 200 million barrels and investments will be around NOK 18.6 billion. All contracts are subject to the authorities’ approval of the PDO. The licence partners in Breidablikk are Equinor (operator), Petoro AS, Vår Energi AS and ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS.",
          "Digital technologies boosted earnings by over two billion NOK in the first year at Johan Sverdrup Digital solutions help increase subsurface understanding, ensure more efficient start-up of wells, higher stable production and more efficient maintenance. “Our experience shows that digital tools have a positive effect on value creation on the Johan Sverdrup field, while helping improve the workday for people offshore and in the onshore organisation. The use of digital tools provides a better overview of the situation, which in turn contributes to increased safety during daily work offshore and onshore. We accomplish more in a safer and smarter way,” says Rune Nedregaard, vice president for Johan Sverdrup operations. The increased earnings are mainly a result of: Higher stable production by means of automated production optimization. Improved accuracy in the reservoir by means of broader and more complex data sets, providing us with more information about the reservoir. More efficient operations and maintenance by means of the solutions for the digital field worker where the operators use tablets in their daily work and the digital twin, which is a virtual copy of the platform.

          "Oil and gas discovery close to North Sea Fram field “We are working continuously on keeping an exploration portfolio that forms the basis for high value creation and in addition can be produced with a low carbon footprint. This discovery contributes to reaching this goal,” says Nick Ashton, Equinor’s senior vice president for exploration in Norway. Wells 35/11-24 S, 35/11-24 A and 35/11-24 B were drilled around 7 kilometres west of the Fram field and 130 kilometres northwest of Bergen. The discovery demonstrates the importance of continuous learning. Based on investment in new data and exploration wells that Equinor drilled last year, we have developed new understanding of the underground in one of the most mature and developed areas on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). “This strongly indicates that it is still possible to prove new and profitable resources that can utilise existing infrastructure on the NCS,” says Ashton. The purpose of the wells was to prove petroleum in the Upper Jurassic rocks of the Heather formation. Well 35/11-24 S encountered a hydrocarbon column totalling 42 metres in sandstone layers in the Heather formation, of which 21 metres interval were gas and 7 metres in sandstone of mainly moderate to good reservoir quality and 21 metres interval were oil and 17 metres in sandstone of good to moderate reservoir quality. Well 35/11-24 A encountered a total gas column of 25 metres and up to 6 metres in moderate quality sandstone in the Heather formation. Well 35/11-24 B encountered an oil column of minimum 3 metres in good-quality sandstone in the Heather formation. The wells were not formation-tested, however extensive data acquisition and sampling were carried out. All wells were concluded in the Heather formation from the Late Jurassic epoch at a depth of 3000-3600 metres. Water depth in the area is 356 metres. The wells have been permanently plugged and abandoned. The licensees will evaluate the discovery for a potential tie-in to existing infrastructure in the area. The wells were drilled by the West Hercules drilling rig, which will proceed to drill wildcat well 6407/1-8 S in the Apollonia prospect in production licence 263 D in the Norwegian Sea.",
          "The Breidablikk field ready for development The expected production from the field is about 200 million barrels, investments totalling about NOK 18.6 billion. “The Breidablikk field is one of the largest undeveloped oil discoveries on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Field development will create substantial value for the Norwegian society and the owners. We are also pleased to award two key contracts today at a total value of NOK 3.3 billion, including options. The contracts will contribute to important activity for the supply industry and secure jobs for many years,” says Geir Tungesvik, Equinor’s acting executive vice president for Technology, Projects and Drilling. The development concept chosen for the Breidablikk field is subsea development with 23 oil producing wells from four subsea templates that are controlled from Grane. Breidablikk will be tied in to the Grane platform for oil processing prior to being brought ashore at the Sture terminal. The production from Grane will be monitored with advanced digital tools from Equinor's integrated operations centre (IOC) at Sandsli to ensure optimal production and value creation from the wells. “I am pleased that we together with our partners have matured the Breidablikk field to development. Breidablikk shows how the industry’s combined competencies create high value and returns from a world-class infrastructure on the NCS,” says Arne Sigve Nylund, Equinor’s executive vice president for Development and Production Norway. “Breidablikk will contribute significantly to maintaining profitable production in one of our core areas on the NCS,” Nylund adds. The Breidablikk development will include a control cable system for electricity and communication (DC/FO). This is a relatively new technology that can reduce the costs associated with further development of the field, in addition to facilitating the use of docking stations for subsea drones on the seabed. The phase-in of Breidablikk will reduce the CO 2 intensity on the Grane field. Securing jobs in the supply industry The contract for subsea production facilities is awarded to Aker Solutions. The contract covers the delivery of four subsea templates and up to 23 subsea trees and associated components. The contract value is estimated at about NOK 2.5 billion, including options. Around 300 man-years in Norway will be associated with the project for the supplier, with project management and engineering at Fornebu and Tranby, fabrication in Egersund and Sandnessjøen and service organisation in Ågotnes. In addition, there will be deliveries from the UK, Malaysia and Brazil. Wood, the maintenance and modification supplier for Grane, has performed studies for the Breidablikk project, and an option for engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI) will now be exercised for the company. The work scope includes equipment installation on the Grane platform in order to receive oil from the Breidablikk subsea facility.",
          "Existing processing equipment and water purification system on the platform will be upgraded. With an estimated value of about NOK 800 million the contract is expected to create over 500 man-years in Norway. The engineering work will be performed in Sandefjord and the fabrication will take place in Stavanger. Earlier this year TechnipFMC won a contract for pipelaying in the Breidablikk project with options for subsea installation. The award contributes to sustaining workplaces for TechnipFMC in Norway, including the Orkanger spool base, where the pipelines will be fabricated before they are reeled onto the installation vessel. All contracts have not been awarded, however about 70% of the value creation in the development phase is expected to go to Norwegian companies. The contracts are subject to government approval of the plan for development and operation. Oil will be transported through the Grane oil pipeline to the Sture terminal in Øygarden municipality for storage and shipping. The field will be operated from Equinor’s Sandsli facilities in Bergen. Breidablikk is being phased in during a period of declining oil production at Grane and will help maintain the activity level on the platform. First oil from the field is scheduled for the first half of 2024. Partners: Equinor Energy AS (operator), Petoro AS, Vår Energi AS and ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS.",
          "Noble Lloyd Noble to drill at Valemon The contract includes an option for drilling one extra well at the Valemon field, and 11 wells that are not included in the same licence. The rig contractor also received a master frame agreement with Equinor. The total value of the day rates for the fixed part of the contract is estimated at around USD 51 million. Additional cost includes integrated services such as managed pressure drilling, treatment of cuttings and wastewater as well as running casing and tubing, further, rig modifications, mobilization and demobilization. “We are very pleased with the job this rig has done for us at the Mariner field off the coast of Scotland, in particular the safety culture,” says Erik G. Kirkemo, senior vice president of drilling & well operations. “With strong on-board leadership they have embedded best practice for safety and have not had any incidents so far in 2020. Through good planning and collaboration, they have achieved strong operational results close to what we define as a perfect well. We look forward to continuing the collaboration on the Norwegian continental shelf as well.” Being the world’s tallest jack-up rig, Noble Lloyd Noble can stand on the seabed in up to 150 metres of water under tough weather conditions. The Valemon drilling campaign is estimated to take around 230 days. “Equinor is exploring new ways of working with suppliers to increase efficiency and create value together. Long-term collaboration with suppliers who deliver on our expectations is an important element in that respect. This way we reward safe and efficient deliveries and keep building on experience and improvement results achieved in past projects,” says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer.

          "Equinor drilling new wells on the Martin Linge field In four gas wells that were drilled at Martin Linge before 2018 well barrier deficiencies that are considered to make them inappropriate for safe production have been established. Petoro has carried out an independent assessment of well barriers that support the operator's view. “The wells are considered safe as they are now, but we will keep them plugged and under continuous monitoring until we have reduced the pressure in the formation by producing from other wells. Safety is always priority number one,” says Geir Tungesvik, acting EVP for Technology, Projects and Drilling in Equinor. The Martin Linge plant is designed for a mixture of oil and gas, and needs gas wells that produce at a certain rate for start-up and production. “Our number one priority is to ensure safe start-up of the field. We will therefore plan to drill up to three new gas wells in addition to the two remaining wells from the plan for development and operation (PDO) for the field to produce as originally planned,” says Tungesvik. The costs of drilling up to three new wells total about NOK 2 billion. Equinor will give an update on all projects under development to Norwegian authorities, including the consequences of Covid-19. The plan will be published in connection with the presentation of the state budget in October. The Maersk Intrepid drilling rig recently started the drilling operations at Martin Linge. Equinor is the majority shareholder and operator of Martin Linge (70%). Petoro (30%) is the only partner.",

          "Contract award for the Snøhvit Future project The FEED contract has an estimated value of NOK 140 million and will contribute with about 80 man-years for Aibel. All work under the FEED contract will be performed in Norway. The FEED work will cover two sub-projects under the Snøhvit Future development: onshore compression and Hammerfest LNG electrification. \"Snøhvit Future is a complex project that will require large modification work at the Hammerfest LNG plant. By awarding the FEED contract to Aibel we enable continuity and experience transfer. Aibel knows the plant well, having provided maintenance and modification services there since the production start in 2007”, says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor chief procurement officer. The first sub-project involves the construction of an onshore compression station at the Hammerfest LNG plant. As the pressure in the wells on the Snøhvit field decreases, there will be a need for pressure support to maintain plateau production at the plant. The onshore compression station would be expected to contribute to an increase of the recovery factor from the Snøhvit field. Equinor and partners plan a concept select decision for the compression scope during autumn 2020. The second sub-project is related to investigating electrification of the Hammerfest LNG plant to minimize the Snøhvit carbon footprint. By replacing current gas turbines with power from shore, it may be possible to reduce CO2 emissions to near zero. Equinor and partners plan a concept select decision for the electrification scope in the end of 2020. “With the Snøhvit Future project we aim to ensure further value creation from the Snøhvit field and to deliver on our ambitions for emission reductions in Norway. The Snøhvit field contains enough gas to maintain production beyond 2050, and Hammerfest LNG will secure jobs for many years to come,” says Trond Bokn, acting senior vice president for project development in Equinor. Equinor and partners are working towards two final investment decisions (FIDs) for the sub-projects in the second half of 2021. Given FIDs and regulatory approval Equinor and partners have the possibility to exercise for each sub-project an option for engineering, procurement, construction and installation (EPCI), that is included in the FEED contract. The Snøhvit partners together with Aibel will use the next year to plan the work in detail to ensure it can be executed safely and efficiently. During the FEED period Aibel will also have a close dialogue with local suppliers of relevant goods and services about opportunities that may come up during the implementation stage of the sub-projects. Earlier this year Equinor conducted an industry seminar in Hammerfest to inform local suppliers about the project and help them establish a relationship with the potential main contractors. The Snøhvit Unit partners are: Equinor Energy",

          "Equinor completes world’s first logistics operation with a drone to an offshore installation “Development is rapid, and we see a huge potential within drone technology that could transform the way we operate, both under and above the sea surface. Equinor aims to lead the way in utilising new technology on the Norwegian continental shelf,” says Arne Sigve Nylund , Equinor’s executive vice president for Development and Production Norway. “Drones could reinforce safety, boost production efficiency and contribute to lower CO2 emissions from Norwegian oil and gas. Drones will also play a role as we shape new energy solutions on the Norwegian shelf,” Nylund continues. The flight spanning around 80 kilometres to the Troll field took about one hour, at an altitude of approx. 5000 feet. The flight was a test, the world’s first of its kind, where an actual freight operation was conducted over a lengthy distance to an operating offshore installation. The drone was a Camcopter s-100 model, manufactured by Schiebel. This type of drone has been thoroughly tested and has logged around 70,000 flying hours from other types of operations within the defence and coast guard services. The drone is more than four metres long and weighs in excess of 100 kilograms. It has a cruising speed of more than 150 km/h and it can carry cargo weighing up to 50 kg. The operator of the drone is the Sandnes-based company Nordic Unmanned, a leader in drone services in Europe. Equinor and the drone operator have enjoyed good cooperation with the Civil Aviation Authority, Avinor Air Navigation Services and the Norwegian Communications Authority in completing this ground-breaking transport operation. “Over the longer term, we expect to see new infrastructure for logistics and support operations, which can reinforce what we already have within vessels and helicopters,” says Alena Korbovà Pedersen, who heads the work on developing logistics solutions in Equinor. “If we are to develop the logistics solutions of the future on the Norwegian shelf, where drones could play an important role, we must cooperate across all of the industry’s players; operating companies, suppliers, the authorities and the trade union and safety interests,” Pedersen continues. In addition to conducting logistics operations, airborne drones can also be used for inspections and observations of the technical condition of our offshore installations and onshore facilities. They have extremely advanced camera equipment and can be used in search and rescue operations, for example to locate people who have fallen into the sea, or for early detection of pollution on the sea. These abilities were also tested during yesterday’s flight. Drones will also play a role in new energy solutions on the NCS. Drones can inspect wind turbines, deploy equipment to be used by",

Now we will work on evaluating the potential for profitable and CO2 efficient recovery,” says Nick Ashton, Equinor’s senior vice president for exploration in Norway and the UK. The well was drilled approximately 17 kilometres south of the Kvitebjørn field and 10 kilometres north of Huldra. The primary exploration target of exploration well 30/2-5 S was to prove hydrocarbons in the Middle Jurassic reservoir of the Brent Group. The well encountered about a 160-metre high gas column, of which 60 metres represent an effective Middle Jurassic reservoir rock. Poor to satisfactory reservoir quality was encountered in the Ness, Etive and Tarbert formation, while the Rannoch formation had poor reservoir quality. The well was not formation tested however extensive amounts of data have been acquired and samples have been taken. The well was drilled to a vertical depth of 4359 metres below sea level. Water depth in the area is 142 metres. The well was permanently plugged and abandoned. This is the first exploration well to be drilled in production licence 878. The licence was awarded in the Awards in Predefined Areas 2016 (APA 2016). The licence owners will consider whether to pursue the discovery in an overall assessment of the area. The well was drilled by the West Hercules drilling rig, which is moving on to drill exploration well 35/11-24 S, a prospect named Swisher, in production licence 248 C. The licence owners of production licence 878 are Equinor Energy AS (60%), Source Energy (20%) and Wellesley Petroleum AS (20%).",

          "Fire at Tjeldbergodden methanol plant extinguished When the fire started, both the air separation plant and the methanol plant were shut down. Personnel at the factory were evacuated and all emergency response procedures were implemented. Equinor's emergency response organisation was mustered and authorities were notified. Nobody was injured in the fire. We are working to get an overview of the consequences and the cause of the fire. Equinor has clear priorities in a crisis. Our first priority is to attend to the people who are involved in the situation, then, the environment and our surroundings, and finally to protect the technical integrity of the plant and our industrial interests.",
          "PSA's inspection report on Hammerfest LNG completed In a press release published on 2 October Equinor informed about the PSA’s verbal summary of the inspection and that the company had immediately started improving the conditions pointed out by the PSA. The PSA’s report in writing confirmed the findings communicated in the verbal summary and concludes that a systematic approach to the application and execution of deviation handling is missing. The report further indicates a lack of correction and follow-up of conditions pointed to by the PSA during former inspections. The PSA report states that the inspection has proven serious breaches to the regulations on deviation handling and orders Equinor to review the company’s system for recording and follow-up of identified deviations, secure handling of identified deviations and implement measures that are required to secure compliance with the company’s systems for recording and follow-up of deviations. “We take the feedback in the PSA’s inspection report very seriously. We will study the feedback carefully and respond to the orders and close the deviations. We have started implementing, or already implemented, measures regarding several of the deviations stated in the PSA’s report, and we will work on closing the remaining issues with quality by deadlines agreed with the PSA,” says Grete B. Haaland, senior vice president for Equinor’s onshore plants. “The employees at Hammerfest LNG are working hard to ensure safe operation, follow up measures and carry out improvements at the plant. They are now working on repairing and resuming operation safely at the plant after the consequential damages of the fire in September. The PSA’s inspection report documents that some deviations have not been properly followed up, and we will now go through and improve our systems and processes. This will be done in collaboration with our employees in the follow-up of the inspection report going forward,” says Andreas Sandvik, vice president of the Hammerfest LNG plant.",
          "Changes in Equinor’s corporate structure and Corporate Executive Committee -Equinor is developing as a broad energy company. We are now making changes to further strengthen our ability to deliver on our always safe, high value, low carbon strategy. These changes will support improved value creation from our world-class oil and gas portfolio, accelerated profitable growth within renewables and the development of low carbon solutions, says Anders Opedal, President and CEO of Equinor. Organisational structure The new corporate structure will consist of six business areas and five corporate centre units. The current organisational structure will remain in place until the planned implementation takes effect by 1 June 2021. New organisational structure: Business Areas: Exploration & Production Norway (EPN) and Exploration & Production International (EPI) are established as two new business areas. They will continue competitive and resilient oil and gas exploration and production, with industry-leading unit costs, recovery rates and carbon efficiency. Equinor is well positioned with world-class assets in attractive areas. Two consolidated oil and gas business areas will support a focused approach to strengthen value creation and reduce emissions. Renewables (REN) continues as a business area, renamed from New Energy Solutions (NES), aiming to accelerate profitable growth within renewables. It will report as a separate segment from the first quarter of 2021. Equinor is establishing Technology, Digital & Innovation (TDI) as a separate business area, while Projects, Drilling & Procurement (PDP) will become a more focused business area. Technology, digitalisation and innovation are fundamental enablers to improve safety, increase value creation, reduce emissions and develop low carbon solutions. Gathering units in a new TDI business area will unlock opportunities both within oil and gas, renewables and low carbon solutions. Marketing, Midstream & Processing (MMP ) is unchanged as a business area. Corporate centre units: The Corporate Finance Organisation (CFO) will also include units for strategy, mergers & acquisitions and business development. Safety, Security & Sustainability (SSU) will be established as a new functional area. Legal & Compliance (LEG), Communication (COM) and People & Organisation (PO) will remain as functional areas. The announced changes in the corporate structure will support continuous improvement and reduce the overall number of leadership positions but does not in itself lead to redundancies. Corporate Executive Committee “The changes in the CEC team reflect a good mix of continuity and renewal, diversity and experience from across Equinor and the industry. With this new team and a highly competent organisation, we are ready to take Equinor forward together,” says Opedal.

We see the results of our forceful response to the market turmoil, with significant cost improvements and strict financial discipline. Net impairments in the quarter are mainly due to reduced price assumptions. Significant uncertainty remains around the future commodity price development underlining the importance of increased competitiveness and financial resilience,” says Eldar Sætre, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. “We deliver solid operational results in the quarter with an underlying production growth of nine percent. We progress our competitive project portfolio, supported by the tax policy measures in Norway, with the delivery of Plan for Development and Operation of the Breidablikk field. Our specialised organisation for late-life production at the Norwegian continental shelf had a successful start-up showing improved production efficiency and reduced cost,“ says Sætre. “We continue to capture value from our renewable energy portfolio and position ourselves for profitable growth in value chains for carbon capture and storage. This quarter we announced our partnership with BP, including the divestment of half of our share of offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US. We are progressing H2H Saltend, a project for large-scale production of hydrogen in the UK, and in Norway we are progressing the Northern Lights project as part of creating full value chains for carbon capture, transportation and storage,” says Sætre. Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 0.78 billion in the third quarter, down from USD 2.59 billion in the same period in 2019. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 0.27 billion, down from USD 1.08 billion in the same period last year. Low prices for liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter. Equinor is on track to deliver on the action plan launched in March 2020 of USD 3 billion to strengthen financial resilience, including a reduction of operating costs of USD 0.70 billion. Unit production costs are significantly reduced from third quarter last year. In the E&P Norway segment, Equinor saw weak prices impacting the results but took advantage of the flexibility",

Results in the E&P International segment were impacted by low prices, partially offset by a substantial reduction in costs. The E&P USA segment was also impacted by weak prices, while continuing efforts to reduce activity and costs. The Marketing, midstream and processing segment captured value from gas sales to Europe, offset by slightly negative refinery margins in the quarter. New energy solutions delivered a positive result in the quarter, including costs related to maturation of new projects. A capital gain of around USD 1 billion from the divestment of a 50% non-operated interest of the offshore wind projects Empire Wind and Beacon Wind in the US is expected to be booked in the first quarter of 2021. IFRS net operating income was negative USD 2.02 billion in the third quarter, down from negative USD 0.47 billion in the same period of 2019. IFRS net income was negative USD 2.12 billion in the third quarter, down from negative USD 1.11 billion in the third quarter of 2019. Net operating income was impacted by net impairments of USD 2.93 billion mainly due to reduced future price assumptions as well as some reductions in reserves estimates. Net impairments include USD 1.38 billion in the E&P USA segment, of which USD 1.21 billion is related to US onshore. Impairments in the E&P International segment were USD 1.18 billion, while impairments within the E&P Norway segment was USD 0.37 billion. In total, USD 0.58 billion of the net impairment was recognised as exploration expenses. Equinor delivered total equity production of 1,994 mboe per day in the third quarter, up from 1,909 mboe per day in the same period in 2019, with an increased share of gas. Adjusting for portfolio transactions and government-imposed curtailments, this represents an underlying production growth of around 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019. At the end of the third quarter Equinor has completed 26 exploration wells with 13 commercial discoveries and two wells under evaluation. At the quarter end, 16 wells were ongoing. Adjusted exploration expenses in the quarter were USD 0.30 billion, compared to USD 0.26 billion in the same quarter of 2019. Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 10.2 billion in the first nine months of 2020, compared to USD 16.6 billion in the first nine months of 2019.

          "Long-term outage for Hammerfest LNG In addition to damage caused by the fire on the air intake on one of the plant's five power turbines, large amounts of seawater from the extinguishing have damaged other auxiliary systems such as electrical equipment and cables in the plant. It is the scope of work of this consequential damage that are considered the most extensive and the duration of the shutdown will depend on the delivery time of necessary equipment. Progress will also be affected by the current restrictions related to the Covid 19 virus. \"Safety is the first priority and we will not start the plant until we are sure that it can be done in a safe way. Therefore, we have worked systematically and thoroughly to survey the damage after the fire, and assess the technical condition of the plant,\" says plant director Andreas Sandvik. \"Although a lot of inspection work still remains and there is still significant uncertainty, our best estimate now is that that it may take up until 1 October 2021 to get Hammerfest LNG back into production.\" \"We will use the shutdown period to also carry out other maintenance and repair work planned for 2021. This includes both ongoing maintenance and maintenance planned in a planned turnaround next spring,\" Sandvik says.

          "Publication of report from the review into Equinor’s US business “We have received a thorough and critical report. Equinor has recorded large financial losses in the US. These were mainly driven by an ambitious growth strategy and investments that were based on overly optimistic price assumptions. In addition, rapid growth for a period led to significant control problems. The board and management should have seen and addressed this sooner. It is now the responsibility of the board and management to ensure that we learn from this experience. The report also confirms that comprehensive improvement efforts were launched when the extent of the challenges were identified in 2014. We have a good foundation on which to follow up the recommendations in the report, and this job has already started,” says board chair of Equinor, Jon Erik Reinhardsen. The report describes how Equinor followed a growth strategy when building the US onshore business, and how this came at the expense of value and control. The onshore acquisitions in the period from 2008 to 2011 were based on overly optimistic price assumptions and were not robust when prices fell from 2014. This has led to large losses, and impairments in the onshore business of 9.2 billion USD as of the end of 2019. The report also describes how Equinor experienced serious challenges in business support functions such as production revenue accounting, land management and procurement in the onshore business. The review is based on over 120 interviews and documentation going back to 2005. On Equinor’s US onshore business: Equinor’s growth strategy came at the expense of value and control. Rapid growth outpaced and overwhelmed critical business support processes. Corporate oversight should have been stronger and did not sufficiently reflect the underlying risks of the business. Limited onshore competence experience in senior leadership teams and a lack of continuity in important roles negatively impacted the performance and follow-up of the onshore business. From 2014, comprehensive improvement efforts were launched by the administration and reported regularly to the board. Today, the internal control environment in the US organisation is significantly improved. Equinor’s growth strategy came at the expense of value and control.

Relevant findings from the internal audit reports of Equinor’s US and international business have been addressed and closed, except for certain specific issues where improvements are still ongoing. The review team has identified areas that can be further strengthened: within strategy and business development; governance, risk and internal control; and leadership and culture. “We point to how Equinor had clear weaknesses and challenges with internal control in the US. Since the onshore acquisitions, a lot has changed in Equinor. We still see room for improvement, and the recommendations reflect this. They primarily cover how Equinor acquires and integrates assets and companies outside its core business,” says head of the review team, Eli Moe-Helgesen . The recommendations include creating a more systematic approach to learning from investments for future business development, developing more tailored governance structures, improving collaboration and corporate oversight when entering new markets, ensuring that leaders have the right experience and expertise, and improving continuity in key roles. CEO Eldar Sætre says that Equinor takes the findings in the report seriously. “I know this is tough reading for many. We made investments that were no longer robust when the market turned, and we should have seen the control problems in the onshore business earlier. Our job now is to learn, and to turn the recommendations into concrete actions to ensure we do not experience something similar again,” says Sætre. * * * Equinor invites to a press conference in connection with the presentation of a report on Equinor’s business in the US.

The main reasons for the cost increase in the project portfolio this year is driven by Covid-19 and weakened Norwegian krone. The Martin Linge, Johan Castberg and Njord projects have experienced the largest changes since the PDOs were submitted and will see postponed start-up and cost increases as a result of increased scope of work, infection control measures and the weak Norwegian krone. “Equinor has a solid and good project portfolio. We have delivered Johan Sverdrup phase 1 and Utgard ahead of schedule and under budget. Large-size developments such as Johan Sverdrup phase 2 and Snorre Expansion Project are still on the original schedule, and we recently submitted the PDOs for Sleipner partial electrification, Northern Lights and Breidablikk”, says Geir Tungesvik, acting executive vice president for Technology, Projects & Drilling. “At the same time, I will emphasize that 2020 has been a very challenging year also for our industry. Together with our suppliers we have worked hard to mitigate the consequences of Covid-19. Safety and infection control measures are our number one priority, and I am impressed by the work that has been done,” says Tungesvik. Quarantine rules, occasionally limited mobility for personnel, reduced manpower and social distancing requirements have resulted in lower activity on most construction sites. This causes delays, cost increases and consequences for further work. As a result of this the start-up of some projects will also be postponed. “We and the suppliers have got a new work situation and are closely monitoring the development of the pandemic. The situation is still unpredictable, and we cannot rule out that Covid-19 may have additional consequences for the progress and costs of our projects,” says Tungesvik. In addition, a weakened Norwegian krone in the past year has driven cost increases for several of the projects under development. Several large-scale contracts, also with Norwegian suppliers, are priced fully or partly in foreign currency. Since the PDO in 2012 the costs related to Martin Linge have increased by almost 30 billion 2020 NOK, a 96 percent cost increase. According to the plan from the former operator Total the project would come on stream in 2016. Equinor took over the operatorship and Total’s 51 percent interest in 2018. Start-up is postponed until the summer of",
          "Following up the fire at Hammerfest LNG \"The incident at Hammerfest LNG (HLNG) this week was serious. We are very grateful for the efforts of local emergency services and for the work Equinor's own emergency response organization did to put out the fire in a very demanding situation. We are glad that no one was injured in the fire or in fighting it. That is the most important thing for us,\" says Irene Rummelhoff, executive vice president of Marketing, Midstream and Processing at Equinor. \"The fire was dramatic, especially for employees, suppliers and neighbors in Hammerfest. We are following up everyone who works at Hammerfest LNG with information about the incident and how we handle it further. This work includes town halls and meetings at unit level. In addition, those who feel the need for it can talk to health professionals,\" says Rummelhoff. There is also a need for information about the incident and the plant’s safety measures among the local community. \"The fact that many in Hammerfest have experienced the incident as very dramatic is something that we take very seriously. We have had meetings with local politicians and the local community in Hammerfest to inform and answer questions, and we will continue to engage with the local community in the coming weeks,\" says Rummelhoff. Both the PSA and Equinor are investigating the incident to clarify the course of events and to find triggering and underlying causes and the police is also investigating the incident. Equinor had before the date of the fire initiated an investigation of a gas leak that occurred around two weeks ago. Although there is no indication of a connection, Equinor will also investigate if the fire can in any way be related to the leak. In addition, the investigation will seek to clarify if the power outage in Hammerfest on 28 September was related to the fire. \"Equinors' and the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway's investigation will be important in identifying measures that will prevent similar incidents from happening again. We will support the investigation and the police investigation where there is a need for it,\" says Rummelhoff. Equinor has established a separate project that will assess the condition of the plant and take measures to ensure a safe start-up in due course. \"We are now working to map the extent of damages after the fire and will then thoroughly review the technical integrity of the facility. Safety comes first, and we will use the time we need to ensure a safe start-up. It is still too early to say when the operations can resume,\" says Irene Rummelhoff. Equinor will revert with updated information about the start-up of Hammerfest LNG at a later date. In",
          "the week before the incident, the PSA carried out an inspection of electric systems and major accident preparedness at the facility, and on Thursday 24 September they verbally shared a first summary after the inspection. Here, the PSA informed that they had observed that some items had not been satisfactorily followed up by Equinor since the same type of audit was last carried out in 2017, and that incorrect registrations have been made in the system which is used for following this up. \"Equinor takes the PSA’s feedback seriously and has already started examining the basis for the findings to address pending items while we wait for the PSA’s final report from the inspection. We will also evaluate whether the findings are isolated cases or if there is a need to address routines and systems,\" says Rummelhoff.",

          "Equinor second quarter 2020 results The second quarter was characterised by Financial results impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and very low commodity prices. Strong trading results, capturing significant value in volatile markets. Overall solid operational performance and cost reductions. After tax results positively impacted by temporary tax changes in Norway. Net debt ratio (1) increased to 29.3% due to very low commodity prices and tax payments from 2019 earnings. Financial results impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and very low commodity prices. Strong trading results, capturing significant value in volatile markets. Overall solid operational performance and cost reductions. After tax results positively impacted by temporary tax changes in Norway. Net debt ratio (1) increased to 29.3% due to very low commodity prices and tax payments from 2019 earnings. “Our financial results for the second quarter were impacted by very low realised oil and gas prices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but also by a strong trading performance in volatile markets. We now see gradual reopening of society in some parts of the world, while other regions are still heavily impacted by the pandemic. Equinor has taken forceful actions to protect the safety of our people, and to contribute positively in society and mitigate the spread of the virus. We have also been able to maintain stable operations and implemented several measures to safeguard our financial strength,” says Eldar Sætre, President and CEO of Equinor ASA. “We have reduced costs, maintained solid operational performance and continued to prioritise value over volume by deferring significant flexible gas production to periods with higher expected prices. We also continued to progress our highly competitive project portfolio, supported by active policy measures in Norway enabling the industry to continue to work on planned projects that will stimulate new investments and maintain activity in a challenging period. Since the start of the quarter, we have signed contracts and framework agreements for more than 10 billion kroner to competitive suppliers in Norway,” says Sætre. “We expect market volatility to continue going forward. The long-term market implications from Covid-19, with possible lower demand and reduced investments in the industry, remain uncertain. However, Equinor’s strategic direction remains firm and we are committed to develop Equinor as a broad energy company to create value in a low carbon future. Together with our partners, we have taken positive investment decisions for transportation and storage of CO2 in the Northern Lights project and for the Sleipner field to be partly electrified with renewable energy from shore,” says Sætre. Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 0,35 billion in the second quarter, down from USD 3.15 billion in the same period in 2019. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 0.65 billion, down from USD 1.13",
          "billion in the same period last year. Very low realised prices for both liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter, while trading operations in volatile markets captured significant value. Equinor is on track to deliver on the announced plan for reducing costs (2) for 2020 by around USD 700 million compared to original estimates. Upstream operating costs and the unit production costs are significantly reduced from the second quarter of 2019. For E&P Norway Equinor saw very low commodity prices and production was impacted by deferring significant gas volumes to later periods to capture higher expected value as well as government imposed oil production curtailments. As from the second quarter, Equinor has established E&P USA as a separate reporting segment. Results in this segment were impacted by very low commodity prices, while significant cost reductions contributed positively. Results in the E&P International segment (excluding E&P USA) were also impacted by low prices, despite a reduction of operating costs. The Marketing, midstream and processing segment delivered a record high result in the quarter, particularly from crude oil and liquids trading where values were extracted from a market in contango and ability to utilise the asset portfolio. In addition, there was positive a contribution from renegotiations of gas contracts. New energy solutions delivered an around neutral result in the quarter, including costs related to maturation of new projects. IFRS net operating income was negative USD 0.47 billion in the second quarter, down from USD 3.52 billion in the same period of 2019. IFRS net income was negative USD 0.25 billion in the second quarter, down from USD 1.48 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Net operating income was impacted by net impairment charges of USD 0.37 billion, mainly related to a gas processing plant in Norway and exploration. Equinor delivered total equity production of 2,011 mboe per day in the second quarter, at the same level as in the same period in 2019, with strong growth in liquids production on the NCS. Adjusting for portfolio transactions and government-imposed curtailments, this represents a production growth of more than 4% compared to the second quarter of 2019. The flexibility in some gas fields was used to defer significant production into periods with higher expected gas prices. Successful ramp-up of new fields, including Johan Sverdrup, as well as new well capacity, contributed to growth in production. At the end of the second quarter Equinor has completed 15 exploration wells with 6 commercial discoveries and 2 wells under evaluation. 17 wells were ongoing at the quarter end. Adjusted exploration expenses in the quarter were USD 0.28 billion, compared to USD 0.24 billion in the same quarter of 2019. Cash flows provided by operating",
          "activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 6.86 billion in the first half of 2020, compared to USD 12.0 billion in the first half of 2019. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 4.11 billion for the first six months of 2020. At the closing of the quarter net debt to capital employed (3) was 29.3%, up from 25.8% at the end of the first quarter, mainly as a result of very low commodity prices and tax payments related to 2019 earnings. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, net debt to capital employed (3) was 34.7%. The board of directors has decided a cash dividend of USD 0.09 per share for the second quarter 2020.

          "Equinor awarding Northern Lights contracts Kværner AS has received a letter of award for the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the onshore plant facilities at Energiparken in Øygarden. The onshore plant will receive and store liquid CO 2 before it is exported through a pump and pipeline system for injection offshore. The value of the contract is estimated at around NOK 1.05 billion. The start-up of the work is planned in January 2021, and completion is planned by Q1 2024. Kværner AS is a fully owned subsidiary of Aker Solutions. Aker Solutions AS has been awarded an EPC contract for delivering a subsea injection system for the CO 2 well in the North Sea. The contract is awarded as a call-off under the framework agreement signed with Equinor in 2017. The value of the contract is around NOK 250 million. The work will start in January 2021 with installation and completion in 2023. The contract also includes options for equipment for future wells. Northern Lights will be the first of its kind – an open and available infrastructure enabling transport of CO 2 from industrial capture sites to a terminal in Øygarden for intermediate storage before being transported by pipeline for permanent storage in a reservoir 2600 meters under the seabed. “These contracts are key to the success of the Northern Lights project. We look forward to working together with Aker Solutions and Kværner to deliver on our part of the solution to reduce industrial emissions,” says project director for Northern Lights Sverre Overå. The pre-fabrication for the onshore facilities will be done at Aker Solutions’ yard at Stord before site installation. The scope includes facilities at jetty for import of CO 2 from ships, storage tanks for intermediate storage of CO 2 and process systems. “Equinor aims to become a net-zero energy company by 2050. This requires that we together with our suppliers develop new value chains and projects such as offshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. These projects will enable the supply industry to build new competencies and will create important activity and spin-offs going forward,” says Peggy Krantz-Underland, Equinor’s chief procurement officer. The Northern Lights project is the transport and storage part of Longship, the Norwegian Government’s full-scale carbon capture and storage project. Equinor is developing the project together with Shell and Total as equal partners. The procurement process for the onshore plant facilities is being performed in accordance with the Public Procurement Act (“Lov om Offentlige Anskaffelser”) and the Public Procurement Regulations (“Forskrift om offentlige anskaffelser”). In line with the requirements all the bidders in the competition were yesterday informed of the award decision and there is a standstill period that expires",
          "on 5 January 2021 when the onshore plant facilities contract will be signed.",
          "Shell and Equinor combine digital forces to optimise inventory The goal is for energy companies to have better control over available equipment and to optimise stock levels. Since first deployment in 2017, this proprietary solution has been deployed across Shell’s Upstream, Manufacturing and Integrated Gas assets globally, generating millions of dollars in value through optimized stock levels. In March 2020, Shell and Equinor signed a Digital Collaboration Agreement to work together on digital projects in areas of mutual benefit (and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including competition and anti-trust laws). Next generation solution is the first collaboration to take-place under this agreement. Dan Jeavons, General Manager Data Science at Shell, says: “The collaboration to co-develop the next stage of Shell Inventory Optimiser with Equinor is an important milestone for both our companies; it speaks to the digital cultural and technical strengths we share, and our history of successful collaborations in the supply chain domain and the value we can achieve working in partnership. I look forward to further collaboration with Equinor in the supply-chain and decarbonization domain, with the continued support of our mutual partner Microsoft.” The co-development project will be run through a joint engineering team with digital and discipline specialists from Shell, Equinor and Microsoft all contributing. The tool integrates Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, Azure Databricks and Azure Datalake and will see the tool enhanced with new features to further optimize the algorithm, driving the recommendations and an improved user experience. Both Equinor and Shell users will benefit from these new features. For Equinor, this tool could reduce inventory inflow with as much as 13%, which could save millions. Oddvar Vermedal, VP Emerging Digital Technology for Equinor’s Digital Centre of Excellence, says: “We see many mutual benefits as both companies have applied cloud-based digital solutions as an approach to our industry’s digital transformation. Such collaborations are increasingly important to improve safety, increase value creation, reduce emissions and develop low carbon solutions by applying digital technologies. The first step with the initiative will be to safeguard our operations by rightsizing the inventory level. This will reduce the inventory inflow and establish optimised level of inventory stocks in Equinor. The next step in the co-development will focus on reducing carbon footprint in our supply chain. Therefore, this collaboration is an important step in our digital transformation journey”. Microsoft will be working with Shell and Equinor to the develop the next evolution of Shell Inventory Optimiser , running on Microsoft Azure. “We are committed to supporting the transformation of the energy sector, co-developing solutions with organizations such as Shell and Equinor that aid in the energy transition,” said Darryl Willis, vice president of Energy, Microsoft. “Digital technology is",

          "Go-ahead for the Northern Lights project The funding decision demonstrates the Norwegian government's strong support for the development of a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) value chain, which is essential if Europe is to achieve its carbon neutrality targets. Northern Lights will be the first of its kind – an open and available infrastructure enabling transport of CO 2 from industrial capture sites to a terminal in Øygarden for intermediate storage before being transported by pipeline for permanent storage in a reservoir 2600 meters under the seabed. The project is the transport and storage component of Longship , the Norwegian Government’s full-scale carbon capture and storage project. “Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is important to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. \"Longship\" is the largest climate project ever in the Norwegian industry and will contribute substantially to the development of CCS as an efficient mitigation measure. Working together with the industry, the step-by-step approach has confirmed that the project is feasible. I want to thank the Northern Lights partners Equinor, Shell and Total - and I am looking forward to our continued cooperation,” says Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Tina Bru. “Northern Lights is a true pioneering project and the first of its kind offering a solution to cut emissions from industrial sources in Norway and Europe. We are ready to start realising this project that will be an important part of the climate solution. I want to thank the Norwegian government and for the broad political support in making this a reality. I am certain that we together with our partners and suppliers will make this project a success,” says Equinor CEO Anders Opedal. “The Norwegian government’s initiative and support for what will be the world’s first open source CO 2 , transport and storage project shows real vision and commitment. Northern Lights is designed to provide a service to industrial emitters who can now take action on emissions that can’t be avoided. This is key to bringing real progress towards tackling climate change. Shell will play our part in making this a reality,” says Shell CEO Ben van Beurden. “The development of the carbon capture and sequestration value chain is essential to decarbonize Europe's industries. We are a long-standing partner of Norway, a pioneer country which has more than 20 years of experience in CCS, and today we thank its government for making possible the final investment decision to develop Northern Lights. CCS is key to achieving carbon neutrality in Europe and is fully part of our Climate Ambition to get to net zero emissions by 2050,” says Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of Total.

          "Equinor Ventures invests in Beyonder Equinor Ventures completes the investment in the Stavanger based technology company, Beyonder, developing the world’s most sustainable high-power battery cells for industrial applications. The investment in Beyonder can contribute positively to the energy transition by providing energy storage solutions needed for increased electrification and more variable renewables in the energy system. Beyonder was established in 2016 with the ambition to become the world’s most sustainable battery company producing the next generation of high-power battery cells, super capacitors and lithium capacitors. In four years, the company has developed from a having a strong ambition, to completing a prototype production line based on its proprietary technology. By 2022 Beyonder targets a production capacity of 1500 cells/day. A key ingredient, Beyonder’s patented super activated carbon, is produced from saw dust – a waste product from the forestry industry. As a result of this, Beyonder’s cells do not contain the rare earth metals cobalt and nickel – widely used in the lithium batteries found in electrical vehicles and consumer electronics. In contrast to a large number of lithium battery manufacturers Beyonder will not enter the markets for electrical vehicles but target industrial applications with a strong fit with their cell properties, including safety, high power and long cycle life. These markets include renewable electricity, electrical grids, heavy transportation and charging stations for electrical vehicles and maritime vessels. A strategic rationale for investing in Beyonder is to accelerate the development of a technology that can support Equinor’s ambitions in electrification and renewables – key enablers for the energy transition. Beyonder’s technology has an exciting potential to provide these solutions. It complements the MoU Equinor has entered into with Panasonic and Norsk Hydro by providing exposure to a different segment of the battery cell space. Equinor Ventures took a minority interest in Beyonder and a board seat during a recently completed equity raise, where DSD, Arendals Fossekompani and Must Invest entered as co-investors.",
          "Equinor joins Europe’s biggest green hydrogen project, the NortH2-project “This is a groundbreaking project that Equinor is looking forward to contribute to. The project can be an important part in our efforts to build a competitive position in hydrogen, creating future value and industrial possibilities. Our aim is to be a net-zero energy company by 2050 and developing a profitable low carbon value chain for hydrogen will be an essential part of our transition to become a broad energy company. Hydrogen will be key to decarbonization and net zero efforts for the energy market, especially in otherwise hard to abate sectors which cannot be served by electricity,” says Equinor CEO, Anders Opedal. NortH 2 was launched in February 2020, with Shell, Groningen Seaports Gasunie and the province of Groningen. Equinor joins RWE as new partners to the project. The project will complete a feasibility study by 2021, with the aim to start project development activities in the second half of 2021. The project will have a capacity of 1 GW in 2027, 4 GW by 2030 and 10+ GW by 2040 for electrolysis. This equates to 0.4. million tonnes of green hydrogen production in 2030 and 1 million tonnes green hydrogen production by 2040. This can abate 8 to 10 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions. This is equivalent to the yearly emissions from road traffic in Norway. The rapid growth in offshore wind is well suited to developing a green hydrogen value chain. “NortH 2 fits well with Equinor’s experience and position as a leading offshore wind operator. Hydrogen will add to the competitiveness of renewables in the years to come, by adding value and an alternative route to market for renewables. The development of viable large-scale clean hydrogen value chains twill help meet the Paris agreement targets, says Pål Eitrheim, executive vice president New Energy Solutions in Equinor. Northwest Europe is wellpositioned to develop an integrated hydrogen value chain – from offshore wind development and renewable power generation to production, storage, transport and the sale of green hydrogen. The North Sea has a great potential for large-scale wind development, there is extensive existing natural gas infrastructure that is suitable for storage and large-scale transport of hydrogen, and there are large industrial clusters in the Netherlands and Germany as well as heavy-duty vehicle OEMs that could economically benefit from a ‘first mover’ advantage. NortH 2 expands the energy transition agenda for Equinor by adding a significant green hydrogen value chain. This complements already existing renewable and low-carbon world-class projects like Dogger Bank (offshore wind), Northern Lights (CCS) and H2H Saltend (Blue hydrogen). NortH 2 sets a vision for 4 GW integrated offshore-wind-to-green-hydrogen value chain by 2030, and for 10+",
          "GW by 2040. Through the parallel development of the required hydrogen infrastructure by repurposing existing natural gas infrastructure, the project could supply major Northwest European clusters. By doing so the NortH 2 project will make an important domestic contribution to meet expected quickly growing hydrogen demand and thereby to meet Dutch as well as EU climate targets for 2030. It also ensures long term decarbonisation in line with the Paris Agreement. The project fits well with the agenda of the Northern Netherlands to become a leading region for green hydrogen, supporting economic development and the creation of high-skilled jobs.",

          "The world can reach the climate goals by a balanced economic development “2020 has been an extraordinary year. The impacts of Covid-19 have led to a considerable decline in energy demand, energy prices and global greenhouse gas emissions,” says Eirik Wærness, senior vice president and chief economist of Equinor. Through the Reform, Rivalry and Rebalance scenarios the Energy Perspectives report describes possible outcomes for the development of world economy, the global energy mix, energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions towards 2050. Rebalance is a new scenario in this year’s report, describing how the world can still reach the goals of the Paris Agreement and limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius. “The energy transition is progressing too slowly, and effective actions are required urgently to reach the climate goals. To reach the climate goals, we must establish a new balance in the priorities between economic growth, increased welfare and climate actions. A more equitable global distribution of welfare increase, acknowledging that a cost distribution is required between developed and emerging markets to support the energy transition, describes a more credible path to reaching the climate goals and the UN’s sustainability goal,” says Wærness. In the Rebalance scenario the premise of continued high global economic growth across all regions has been changed. “We do not know for certain how the development will be after the pandemic. It is precisely in times of much uncertainty that scenario planning is more important than ever. The outcome space is big, and the choices made in the next years will be vital for how the world is developing to a sufficient extent in a more sustainable direction,” says Wærness. Rebalance shows a development path towards 2050 where economic growth accelerates in emerging markets, while the growth is lower in developed economies, and: The global energy-related CO 2 emissions will never return to the level they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. The absolute global energy demand is reduced by 15 per cent compared to the 2019 level. Even if the oil demand peak was passed in 2019, there will still be a need for oil and gas in the energy mix. The electricity demand increases by 80 per cent and wind power production must increase around nine times from the present level. Carbon capture and storage must handle around two billion tonnes of CO 2 emissions per year, equivalent to 400 Northern Lights projects. Only 10 per cent of the world’s private cars will be petrol or diesel powered. The global energy-related CO 2 emissions will never return to the level they were before the Covid-19 pandemic.

Carbon capture and storage must handle around two billion tonnes of CO 2 emissions per year, equivalent to 400 Northern Lights projects. Only 10 per cent of the world’s private cars will be petrol or diesel powered. The Reform scenario is based on a market and technology driven development. There will be continued tightening of climate policies in line with the commitments of the Paris Agreement, however, it will not be enough to reach the climate goals. The developed countries are the main drivers of the development, and there is limited success for zero-emission technology, such as carbon capture and storage, and new energy carriers, such as hydrogen. In the Rivalry scenario we assume that climate policy is not sufficiently prioritized and consequently the energy transition is not gaining enough momentum. There are several indications of the development heading in this direction. Trade wars, social and political unrest and regional political conflicts with potential for further escalation are examples of that. In Rivalry these trends continue, leading to protectionism, autocracy, less global cooperation, slower technology development and weak economic growth. Equinor recently announced an ambition of net zero CO 2 emissions from our activities and use of the company’s products by 2050. “Equinor’s strategy will ensure long-term competitiveness in times of significant changes in the global energy systems. Equinor will be a leading company in these changes, and we have set an ambition of becoming a net-zero energy company by 2050. This means that we will be among the best companies in the world in producing oil and gas with low CO 2 emissions. We will accelerate the growth in renewables, and we have projects that can help establish new value chains for carbon capture and storage and hydrogen,” says Anders Opedal, president and CEO of Equinor. This is the 10th year in a row that Equinor is presenting its Energy Perspectives. The driving forces behind the climate challenge have changed considerably, and the energy systems have been through major changes since the first Energy Perspectives report was published. “During these 10 years we have been surprised by the extent and impact of the shale revolution, and coal has been replaced faster than we anticipated. However, we hit the target surprisingly well regarding the growth in renewables during the past ten years. We were also right about the oil demand, but for the wrong reasons. Nobody could predict the dramatic consequences that a pandemic would have",

          "Equinor sets ambition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 “Equinor is committed to being a leader in the energy transition. It is a sound business strategy to ensure long-term competitiveness during a period of profound changes in the energy systems as society moves towards net zero. Over the coming months, we will update our strategy to continue to create value for our shareholders and to realise this ambition,” says Anders Opedal who today took over the position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President of Equinor. Earlier this year, Equinor announced its plans to achieve carbon neutral global operations by 2030 and to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Norway to near zero by 2050. At the same time, Equinor outlined a value-driven strategy for significant growth within renewables, as well as a new net carbon intensity ambition. Continuing to deliver on the short and mid-term ambitions will be key to achieving net-zero emissions. “Equinor has for years demonstrated an ability to deliver on climate ambitions and has a strong track record on lowering emissions from oil and gas. Now, we are ready to further strengthen our climate ambitions, aiming to reach net zero by 2050,” Opedal says. Equinor expects to deliver an average annual oil and gas production growth of around 3 percent from 2019 to 2026. Equinor is well positioned with world-class global assets in attractive areas with substantial value creation potential. By optimizing its portfolio through financial discipline and prioritization, Equinor will continue to develop competitive and resilient projects whilst maintaining industry-leading recovery rates, unit costs and carbon efficiency. The net-zero ambition will strengthen future competitiveness and value creation at the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). Equinor’s plans for production, development and exploration at the NCS remain firm. Equinor is preparing for an expected gradual decline in global demand for oil and gas from around 2030 onwards. Value creation, not volume replacement, is and will be guiding Equinor’s decisions. In the longer term, Equinor expects to produce less oil and gas than today. To develop Equinor as a broad energy company, renewables will be a significant growth area. Equinor has previously set ambitions for profitable growth within renewables and expects a production capacity of 4-6 Gigawatts (GW) by 2026 and 12-16 GW by 2035 (1) . Equinor now plans to expand its acquisition of wind acreage, with the aim of accelerating profitable growth and will continue to leverage its leading position in offshore wind. Equinor will establish renewables as a separate reporting segment from first quarter 2021. (1) Equity share.

          "Building on its capabilities from oil and gas, Equinor is well positioned to provide low-carbon technologies and establish zero-emission value chains. Equinor is driving the development of these technologies through projects such as Northern Lights, which aims to store CO 2 from industrial sites across Europe. Equinor also assumes that an increasing share of oil and gas will be used for petrochemicals towards 2050. “Climate change is a shared challenge. The combined efforts of governments, industries, investors and consumers are crucial to reaching net-zero emissions, for Equinor and for society. Together, we can overcome technological and commercial challenges, cut emissions, and develop CCS and zero-emission value chains for a net-zero future,” says Opedal. Equinor expects to present an updated strategy at its Capital Markets Day in June 2021. Equinor’s net-zero ambition covers scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (operated basis 100%) and scope 3 GHG emissions (use of products, equity share).",
          "Prime Minister Erna Solberg opened the world’s largest test facility for CO2 transport The test facility transports CO 2 in pipelines, both in gas and liquid form. The objective is to learn more about how CO 2 behaves during pipeline transport, which is important knowledge in order to scale up CO 2 transport and storage in the future. \"The work you do here is an important contribution to the government’s strategy for carbon capture and storage,\" Prime minister Erna Solberg said when she officially opened the test facility. Equinor has transported CO 2 from the Sleipner field in the North Sea since 1996 and from the Snøhvit facility in Hammerfest since 2009, both are projects which have provided Equinor with important information about CO 2 transport. In these projects, the CO 2 is transported in gas and liquid form, respectively. Now Equinor and its partners Total, Gassnova and Gassco have modified the facility to make it possible to study transport of CO 2 as gas and liquid, simultaneously. This could yield knowledge that is important for determining where a pipeline route could be laid, and which reservoirs could be utilised. Testing and research can improve operation of the CO 2 transport and storage project Northern Lights and can also reduce the costs associated with this new industry in the future. The test facility was built in 1997. It has been used to test the transport of various combinations of oil, gas and water in the same pipeline, so-called multiphase transport. That’s why the facility is called the Multiphase rig. A total of more than one billion Norwegian kroner has been invested in the test facility, including construction and adaptations during the operations period. The facility is the very heart of Equinor’s research centre in Porsgrunn. The price tag for the modification work was seven million kroner. The test facility has pipes that run in a 200-metre line, and it is the world’s largest test facility for CO 2 transport. “This shows how infrastructure and competence from the oil and gas industry can be used to accelerate efforts to capture CO 2 and store it in reservoir. This is an opportunity to create a new industry in Norway”, says Sophie Hildebrand, Chief Technology Officer in Equinor. The plan is initially to use the test facility for two different CO 2 transport tests, both tests of multiphase transport and testing of measuring instruments. According to the plan, these tests will be under way until the spring of 2021. After that, the test facility will be used to test the transport of both oil, gas and CO 2 , depending on where the needs are greatest.",
          "New partnership to develop offshore CO2 transport and storage in the UK North Sea BP, Eni, Equinor, National Grid, Shell and Total today confirmed they have formed a new partnership, the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP), to develop offshore carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage infrastructure in the UK North Sea, with bp as operator. This infrastructure will serve the proposed Net Zero Teesside (NZT) and Zero Carbon Humber (ZCH) projects that aim to establish decarbonised industrial clusters in Teesside and Humberside. Decarbonisation of UK industrial emissions Net Zero Teesside (NZT) and Zero Carbon Humber (ZCH) are at-scale decarbonisation projects that will kick start decarbonisation of industry and power in two of the UK’s largest industrial clusters. Both projects aim to be commissioned by 2026 with realistic pathways to achieve net zero as early as 2030 through a combination of carbon capture, hydrogen and fuel-switching. If successful, NEP linked to NZT and ZCH will allow decarbonisation of nearly 50% of the UK’s industrial emissions. NEP has submitted a bid for funding through Phase 2 of the UK Government’s Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge, aiming to accelerate the development of an offshore pipeline network to transport captured CO2 emissions from both NZT and ZCH to offshore geological storage beneath the UK North Sea. The £170 million Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge is part of the £4.7bn Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund set up by the UK Government to address the biggest industrial and societal challenges using research and development based in the UK. NEP’s application for funding is an important step towards enabling the development of integrated offshore carbon storage for NZT and ZCH in the UK Southern North Sea. Endurance aquifer enables decarbonisation of two major industrial clusters The application follows the approval by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) of the addition of bp and Equinor alongside National Grid to the Endurance carbon storage licence. This affirms the strategic importance of the Endurance reservoir as the most mature large scale saline aquifer for CO2 storage in the offshore UK Continental Shelf, that can enable industrial decarbonisation from both clusters. bp will lead the Northern Endurance Partnership as operator and the team progressing the project will draw on expertise from across all the partners.

The dataset comprises approximately 850 files and more than 83 Gigabytes, and can be accessed through the Equinor data portal: The Norwegian Full-Scale CCS project “Langskip” is the first industry scale project for capture and storage of CO 2 on the Norwegian continental shelf. Exploitation license EL001 for CO 2 storage, was awarded to the partners in January 2019. The 31/5-7 confirmation well (Eos) within EL001 licence was drilled and tested from 2nd December 2019 to 7th March 2020. The Eos well targeted the Dunlin Group Geological formation as the primary storage, where the sandstone-bearing Cook and Johansen formations both can serve as storage units for the injected CO 2 . The cap rock consists of impermeable claystones called Drake Formation, which prevents the CO 2 from migrating out of the Dunlin Group.",

          "Equinor committing to the Sea Cargo Charter – for more transparent reporting of shipping activity to reach decarbonisation targets United Nations agencies estimate the international shipping industry to carry around 80% of world trade flows and to be responsible for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually. Large industrial corporations are significant users of international shipping services. The Sea Cargo Charter has been developed by a group of charterers to measure and report climate alignment. The ambition is to be transparent on environmental performance to drive improvements. By calculating how effectively each charterer uses its fleet of vessels, and publishing the results, the group hopes to promote openness and accountability in the wider industry. The target is to be in line with the ambitions of the UN’s International Maritime Organization, and by introducing a common way of calculating alignment it will be easier to have a united front and increase awareness in the industry. “Sustainable shipping cannot be achieved by one player alone; we have to collaborate and be transparent to deliver on our maritime ambitions. Equinor is delighted to become a Signatory of the Sea Cargo Charter, and by joining forces with influential and ambitious charterers we aim to pull the industry in the right direction to make shipping more sustainable,” says Heidi Aakre, vice president for Shipping in Equinor ASA. “With around 100 ships in our tanker fleet, we are a significant charterer in the shipping market,” she continues. “We have recently launched our maritime climate ambitions with clear targets for 2030 and 2050. The signing of the Sea Cargo Charter is for us a step towards joining forces with the shipping industry in reaching these targets.”",
          "Equinor and partners progress plan for zero carbon industrial cluster in the UK The application by the Zero Carbon Humber (ZCH) Partnership is a first step to creating the world’s first net zero industrial cluster by 2040 and will support clean growth in the north-east of England. The bid, announced today , for Phase Two funding from the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, builds on a successful application for Phase One funding which was announced in April. The ZCH Partnership includes Equinor, Associated British Ports, British Steel, Centrica Storage Ltd, Drax Group, Mitsubishi, National Grid Ventures, px Group, SSE Thermal, Saltend Cogeneration Company Limited, Uniper, and the University of Sheffield’s Advanced Manufacturing Centre (AMRC). “We are proud to be a leader of Zero Carbon Humber, partnering with a broad group of forward-looking companies. This proposal can bring tremendous benefits to the Humber region, protecting industries, creating jobs, promoting economic growth and reducing emissions. Our bid demonstrates the kind of ambitious action that is needed to for the UK to achieve its net zero carbon target by 2050,” says Al Cook, Equinor executive vice president and UK country manager. The bid centres around two elements, the first being the Equinor-led H2H Saltend (Hydrogen to Humber Saltend) hydrogen project at Saltend Chemicals Park near the city of Hull. H2H Saltend will be largest plant of its kind in the world to convert natural gas to hydrogen, combining a 600 megawatt autothermal reformer with carbon capture. From first production H2H Saltend will reduce industrial emissions by nearly 900,000 tonnes per year. The second element is the hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) pipeline network developed by National Grid Ventures that aims to link H2H Saltend to other industrial sites in the Humber region, enabling them in turn to fuel switch to hydrogen or capture their emissions. These sites include Drax Power station, SSE Thermal’s Keadby site, Uniper’s Killingholme site and British Steel at Scunthorpe. “We believe in the necessity of hydrogen and carbon capture to clean up heavy industry which is required to reach net zero targets. The technologies are proven and it’s now a question of putting them together. We and our partners have made great progress in our plans to decarbonise the Humber, through working with and learning from each other and also in engaging with national and local stakeholders. We are convinced that by continuing to work together we can make this happen,” says Grete Tveit, Equinor senior vice president for low carbon solutions. CO 2 emissions from H2H Saltend and the other Humber sites will be transported by pipeline to Easington on the Yorkshire coast and then offshore to permanent storage under the Southern North Sea on",

Using drones will also enable us to avoid some vessel lifts that can be both more costly and leave a greater environmental footprint. The fact that we chose a 3D printed part for our first drone transport offshore was a very natural choice. 3D printing is another rapidly growing technology that will transform the way we work. The part we transported was a diesel nozzle holder – a critical component in the lifeboats on Troll A. The part is no longer manufactured and is difficult to obtain. Therefore, the part was re-designed and modelled in 3D before an advanced metal 3D printer produced a replica in a sturdy, industrial alloy, Inconel 718. The part was manufactured quickly, and was delivered safely and efficiently to Troll A, Norway’s largest gas producer.",

The board is responsible for presenting a proposal for a name and logo to the company's owners, who will decide on the proposal at the annual general meeting in 2009. The proposal for a new name will symbolise the company's business strategy, value base and vision. In this connection we will not exclude using the Statoil name, but the task assigned to the board is to find a new name. Irrespective of the name recommended by the board to the annual general meeting, the board finds it appropriate to keep Statoil as the name of the company's petrol station activity. Considerable values are tied to the company's name and position in this field, and based on the board's evaluation the company is best served by further developing this brand. The fact that 90% of the costs of any re-branding are related to this part of the company further supports the decision to keep the current well-known name also in the future StatoilHydro has hired Det Norske Veritas (DNV) to look at all parts of the company and calculate the costs of the various alternatives. The costs of re-branding the company's petrol station activity have been estimated by DNV at a gross amount of around NOK 1.9 billion. These costs can be excluded since this part of the company's activity keeps the Statoil name. The costs of the remaining re-branding activities have been estimated to be in the size of NOK 150-200 million. Parts of these costs are unavoidable, since one common visual brand must be implemented on old Statoil and Hydro installations as well as parts currently carrying the StatoilHydro brand.

          "Recommends new organisation of offshore and onshore facilities Executive vice president Hilde Merete Aasheim. The proposed new organisation model will now be discussed with all the employees’ unions in the central union-management committee of StatoilHydro. The goal of the restructuring and integration work is to create a real integration of Statoil and Hydro’s oil and gas activities and also to develop a new, common culture throughout the group. “The purpose of this stage of the integration work is to strengthen the operational parts of StatoilHydro’s activities, create a common culture and make full use of the combined knowledge and experience the group possesses,” Hilde Merete Aasheim, who is leading the integration and restructuring work. “The integration process is an important tool to improve operations and strengthen our focus on health, safety and environment on platforms and onshore facilities,” she says. “We will achieve this by applying best practice from both organisations and establishing more standardised work processes across the organisation.” Planning of the integration and restructuring work has been led by a group of representatives of the group's top management and the unions. Thorough impact assessments of alternative solutions have been made during the process. Agreement has been reached with all the unions in the integration team on the models chosen for gas processing plants, refineries and terminals. With regard to a new organisational solution for the offshore activities and base operations, Industri Energy, Norwegian Society of Engineers (Nito) and the Norwegian Society of Chartered Technical and Scientific Professionals (Tekna) are positive to the proposed solution, but will not give their final reply before the impact assessment has been completed. The Norwegian Union of Energy Workers (Safe)/Confederation of Vocational Unions (YS) has stated that the union does not support the proposed operational model. The Gullfaks A platform in the North Sea (Photo: Øyvind Hagen) A final decision on a new organisational model will be made by the group after the employee representatives have had the opportunity to present their views on the proposed model. StatoilHydro aims to complete the final formal processing during June 2008. The tempo of the restructuring work will be determined by the requirement for safe and efficient operations. This stage of the restructuring work covers the parts of the group’s activities that were not affected by the integration process in 2007. Close to 7,300 employees are affected by this stage of the integration. The first stage of the integration process began before the establishment of StatoilHydro on 1 October 2007 and included around 9,000 employees. The model chosen gives the employees security: All employees are ensured a job in the new organisation All employees on an offshore contract will keep their contract if they prefer. All",

All employees on onshore facilities will keep their employment at the facility No employees will be forced to move to a different geographical location (place of residence) The Åsgard A FPSO in the Norwegian Sea (Photo: Øyvind Hagen) “The management and the unions have had common goals for the integration and restructuring work,” says executive vice president Hilde Merete Aasheim. “We have had a good cooperation on finding solutions that will strengthen StatoilHydro. I would like to commend the employee representatives for a very constructive contribution in this thorough process which started in December 2007. They have given important input to the solutions chosen.” Natural gas and processing plants and terminals In the Natural Gas and the Manufacturing & Marketing business areas, organisational solutions have been developed to strengthen the basis for safe and efficient operation of the gas processing plants at Kårstø and Kollsnes and the processing plants and terminals at Mongstad, Tjeldbergodden, Kalundborg and Sture. The restructuring will further clarify the interfaces with other business areas as well as the roles and responsibilities and the same tasks will be performed in the same way on all onshore facilities. This will improve work efficiency and reduce operational costs. Improved efficiency and savings will benefit the owners of the plants and create a more flexible and robust organisation with increased opportunities for StatoilHydro’s employees. Using the expertise and experience on all offshore installations The restructuring of StatoilHydro’s offshore operations is based on an extensive analysis embracing all the group’s installations. Representatives of management and employees from all involved units and installations have contributed in the process. The merged StatoilHydro is one of the world’s largest offshore operations organisations. During around 40 years, the group has developed a business consisting of 31 installations on the Norwegian continental shelf and a unique basis of experience and knowledge for offshore operations. The extent of the group’s offshore activities forms the basis for exchange and learning across the organisation with a view to improve our safety level and develop new operational modes which lay the foundation for optimal use of the petroleum resources. Tore Torvund, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. ”Our analyses and experiences from the recent serious incidents show that we have a substantial improvement potential in parts of our activities,” says Tore Torvund, executive vice president for Exploration & Production Norway. “At the same time, there are major differences between",
          "the various units with regard to organisation, work processes for daily operation and results. Our goal is to utilise the experience and knowledge in our organisation to establish a common culture and common work processes. The changes we will make are important to maintain StatoilHydro’s position as the best operator in all phases of the activities on the Norwegian continental shelf.” Increased focus on maintenance The company will introduce a new and more consistent organisation of the company’s offshore operations with common work processes, compliance with best practice, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and good planning and maintenance management. StatoilHydro will take care of all management functions and ordinary operations and maintenance tasks offshore itself. The relationship between tasks performed by the company’s employees and those performed by contractors will largely remain the same as today. StatoilHydro will maintain its own catering personnel on platforms using this model today. The new organisation is particularly designed to increase the priority of operating tasks and maintenance, while establishing a more systematic and methodical organisation of non-critical maintenance tasks. All safety-critical functions will be performed on the individual installation. Most employees in the offshore organisation will still belong to a specific installation, but arrangements will be made for a greater degree of flexibility and mobility of personnel between the installations within the three operating areas on the Norwegian continental shelf. ”The purpose of the organisation model for maintenance is to increase the focus on maintenance that is critical to safety and production, and increase the company’s ability to mobilise resources for important maintenance tasks in a flexible way. Another aim is to increase the long-term regularity of the maintenance work,” Torvund says. It is also recommended that offshore engineer positions in the future be included in StatoilHydro’s onshore organisation. If the number of tasks that require engineering skills so require, engineers may be on an offshore rotation schedule. The goal is to improve the interaction with the rest of the onshore organisation and suppliers, and to ensure a more useful distribution of the tasks between the offshore and onshore organisations. Minor changes will be made to the organisation of the company’s logistics functions. Instruments ”The restructuring process will release capacity in the company and form the basis for a more optimal use of the company’s combined skills. The released capacity will be addressed by introducing a voluntary early retirement programme and strengthening priority tasks offshore,” says Hilde Merete Aasheim. Employees who turn 58 by 31 December this year will be allowed to take early retirement on the same conditions as the employees covered by the first part of the integration process. 225 employees at gas processing plants, refineries and terminals will be entitled",
          "to this programme. On offshore installations and supply bases the number is about 700. Early retirement may be taken from 1 April 2009 at the earliest. The company finds it fully possible to ensure safe and effective operations of the company’s offshore activities, even if everyone were to accept the offer. In order to stimulate real integration the employees in the offshore operations will be allowed to report an interest in minimum two positions in the new organisation. Employees who report an interest in a position on a new installation will receive a lump-sum payment of NOK 60,000. Programmes to compensate for relocation of positions from offshore to onshore, and any changes to the rotation programme, have been established in consultation with the employees. Skills development programmes for the employees will also be established. Executive vice president Hilde Merete Aasheim.

          "Solid performance - financial strength StatoilHydro ASA (OSE: STL, NYSE:STO) StatoilHydro's net income in the third quarter in 2008 amounted to NOK 6.3 billion compared to NOK 14.6 billion in the third quarter of 2007 and was negatively affected by the significant strengthening of the US dollar compared to NOK on net financial items and consequently an unusually high tax rate. Net income in the first nine months of 2008 amounted to NOK 41.2 billion, compared to NOK 38.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. In the third quarter of 2008 the net operating income was NOK 47.0 billion, compared to NOK 35.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. For the first nine months of 2008, net operating income amounted to NOK 161.1 billion, compared to NOK 106.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. Adjusted for certain items that are considered to be not reflective of StatoilHydro's underlying operational performance, the adjusted (underlying) net operating income in the third quarter of 2008 was NOK 52.1 billion, compared to NOK 32.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. For the first nine months of the year, adjusted net operating income increased by NOK 53.8 billion to NOK 158.9 billion. The increase in adjusted (underlying) net operating income from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2008 was mainly due to a 36% increase in the realised prices of liquids (crude oil, condensate and NGL), measured in NOK and a 55% increase in natural gas prices, partly offset by a 3% decrease in entitlement volumes. The NOK 53.8 billion increase in underlying net operating income from the first nine months of 2007 to the first nine months of 2008 was mainly due to a 41% increase in realised liquids prices measured in NOK and a 38% increase in natural gas prices. The increase was partly offset by increased operating expenses, mostly in the downstream business, and increased exploration expenses. \"Our operating performance and operating income are strong and we are well positioned industrially and financially in a time with great uncertainty in the financial markets\", says Helge Lund, StatoilHydro's chief executive. \"We are capable of meeting our committed capital expenditures and a competitive dividend pay-out, even with lower oil prices\", says Lund. \"Our equity production in the first nine months was 1.892 million barrels of oil equivalents per day (mmboepd), up 5% compared to the same period in 2007. In total we remain on track to deliver on our 2008 production guiding\", Lund adds. . In the third quarter of 2008, StatoilHydro delivered total liquids and gas entitlement production of 1,550 mboe per day. Lifted volumes decreased by 9% to 1,504 mboe per day.",
          "However, higher prices for liquids and natural gas more than offset the negative effects of decreased lifting, so that net operating income for the third quarter of 2008 increased to NOK 47.0 billion, up 31% from NOK 35.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. In the first nine months of 2008, StatoilHydro delivered total liquids and gas entitlement production of 1,716 mboe per day. Solid production and high prices yielded a net operating income for the first nine months of 2008 of NOK 161.1 billion, compared to NOK 106.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. During the first nine months of 2008, the group gained access to 15 new licenses in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Brazil. This comes in addition to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Peregrino development offshore Brazil. The acquisition is pending governmental approval. StatoilHydro delivered an extensive exploration programme in the first nine months of 2008. Of a total of 60 completed exploration wells by 30 September, 33 were drilled outside of the NCS. Twenty-six discoveries have been declared, of which eight were made outside of the NCS. An additional four wells have been completed since 30 September. In the first nine months of 2008, StatoilHydro delivered three PDOs (Plan for Development and Operation) on the NCS; Yttergryta (18 January), Morvin (15 February) and Troll Field project (27 June). On the NCS StatoilHydro started up production on six fields; Gulltopp (7 April), Oseberg Gamma Main Statfjord (12 April), Vigdis East (15 April), Theta Cook (26 June), Oseberg Delta (27 June) and Vilje (1 August). Internationally, production commenced on Deep Water Gunashli in Azerbaijan (22 April), Saxi and Batuque offshore Angola (1 July) and the Nigerian field Agbami (29 July). Return on average capital employed after tax (ROACE) [*] for the 12 months ended 30 September 2008 was 28.9%, compared to 22.0% for the 12 months ended 30 September 2007. The increase was due to higher net income, partly offset by higher average capital employed. ROACE is defined as a non-GAAP financial measure. [*] In the third quarter of 2008, earnings per share were NOK 2.04, compared to NOK 4.52 in the third quarter of 2007. In the first nine months of 2008, earnings per share were NOK 12.95, compared to NOK 11.86 in the first nine months of 2007. Items impacting in the third quarter of 2008 the net operating income was NOK 47.0 billion, compared to NOK 35.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Net operating income is adjusted for certain items that are considered to be incidental to the period or not reflective of StatoilHydro's underlying operational performance. Adjusted (underlying) net operating income is considered a",
          "supplemental measure to the StatoilHydro's IFRS measures that provides a better indication of StatoilHydro's underlying operational performance in the period. The following items impacted the net operating income in the third quarter of 2008: derivatives had a posive impact of NOK 0.9 billion, while impairment charges (NOK 3.1 billion), underlift (NOK 1.3 billion), an accrual for expected losses on a tolling agreement (NOK 1.3 billion), inventory effects (NOK 0.9 billion) and other non operational accruals (NOK 0.4 billion) had a negative impact. Adjusted for these items and effects of eliminations (NOK 1.0 billion), adjusted (underlying) net operating income was NOK 52.1 billion in the third quarter of 2008, compared to NOK 32.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. The increase was mainly due to a 36% increase in realised prices of liquids measured in NOK, a 55 % increase in gas prices measured in NOK, partly offset by a 3% decrease in entitlement production, higher operating expenses in our downstream business and higher exploration expenses. In the first nine months of 2008 the net operating income was NOK 161.1 billion, compared to NOK 106.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The following items had a positive impact on the net operating income in the first nine months of 2008: derivatives of NOK 5.7 billion, reversal of impairment of NOK 2.1 billion and gain on sale of assets of NOK 1.8 billion. These were partly offset by impairment charges of NOK 5.6 billion, an accrual for expected losses on a tolling agreement (NOK 1.3 billion), underlift of NOK 1.1 billion, accrual for claims (NOK 0.5 billion) and other non operational accruals NOK 0.4 billion. Adjusted for these items, adjusted (underlying) net operating income was NOK 158.9 billion in the first nine months of 2008, compared to NOK 105.1 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The increase was mainly due to a 41% increase in prices of liquids measured in NOK, a 38 % increase in gas prices and a 1% increase in entitlement production, partly offset by higher operating expenses especially in the downstream business and higher exploration expenses. Total liquids and gas liftings in the third quarter of 2008 were 1,504 mboe per day, compared to 1,660 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2007, a decrease of 9%. There was an underlift in the third quarter of 2008 of 29 mboe per day [*] compared to an underlift in the third quarter of 2007 of 36 mboe per day. Total liquids and gas liftings in the first nine months of 2008 were 1,691 mboe per day, compared to 1,718 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2007, a 2% decrease. There",

Total liquids and gas entitlement production in the third quarter of 2008 was 1,550 mboe per day, compared to 1,596 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2007. Average equity [*] production was 1,733 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 1,722 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2007. The decrease in entitlement production mainly stems from increased maintenance activity, shut downs and declining production from maturing fields, but was partly offset by ramp-up in production from new fields coming on stream. Total liquids and gas entitlement production in the first nine months of 2008 was 1,716 mboe per day, compared to 1,692 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2007. Average equity [*] production was up 5% to 1,892 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2008 compared to 1,798 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2007. Increased production mainly stems from new fields coming on stream and a higher gas off-take, but was partly offset by declining production from maturing fields. Exploration expenditure was NOK 4.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008, compared to NOK 3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Exploration expenditure was NOK 11.9 billion in the first nine months of 2008, compared to NOK 9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The increase in both periods was mainly due to higher exploration activity and increased drilling costs. Exploration expenditure reflects exploration activities in the period. Adjusted exploration expenses for the period consist of exploration expenditure adjusted for the period's change in capitalised exploration expenditure and for certain items impacting the net operating income as described above. The adjusted (underlying) exploration expenses increased from NOK 3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2007 to NOK 3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008, mainly due to higher exploration activity and increased drilling costs. Adjusted exploration expenses increased from NOK 6.8 billion in the first nine months of 2007 to NOK 8.5 billion in the first nine months of 2008, mainly due to higher exploration activity and increased drilling costs. In the third quarter of 2008, a total of 15 exploration and appraisal wells and two exploration extension wells were completed, nine on the NCS and six internationally. Ten exploration and appraisal wells and two exploration extension wells have been declared as discoveries. In the third quarter of 2007, a total of 15 exploration and appraisal wells were completed, seven on the NCS and eight internationally.",

[*] Normalised production cost is defined as a non-GAAP financial measure. [*] The production cost per boe, both actual and normalised, has increased significantly, mainly due to non-recurring restructuring costs relating to the merger of Statoil ASA and Hydro Petroleum in 2007, start-up of new fields, increased maintenance cost and general industry cost pressure. Adjusted for restructuring costs and other costs arising from the merger recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 and gas injection costs, the production cost per boe of equity production for the 12 months ended 30 September 2008 was NOK 33.2. The comparable figure for the 12 months ended 30 September 2007 is NOK 29.0. Net financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 9.7 billion in the third quarter of 2008, mainly caused by a NOK 0.75 (14.7%) weakening in relation to the US dollar, compared to an income of NOK 6.5 billion in the third quarter of 2007 mainly caused by a NOK 0.46 (7.8%) strengthening in relation to the US dollar. The NOK 16.3 billion negative change was mostly attributable to currency effects.

The following items impacted the net operating income in the third quarter of 2008: derivatives had a posive impact of NOK 0.9 billion, while impairment charges (NOK 3.1 billion), underlift (NOK 1.3 billion), an accrual for expected losses on a tolling agreement (NOK 1.3 billion), inventory effects (NOK 0.9 billion) and other non operational accruals (NOK 0.4 billion) had a negative impact. Adjusted for these items and effects of eliminations (NOK 1.0 billion), adjusted (underlying) net operating income was NOK 52.1 billion in the third quarter of 2008, compared to NOK 32.8 billion in the third quarter of 2007. The increase was mainly due to a 36% increase in realised prices of liquids measured in NOK, a 55 % increase in gas prices measured in NOK, partly offset by a 3% decrease in entitlement production, higher operating expenses in our downstream business and higher exploration expenses. In the first nine months of 2008 the net operating income was NOK 161.1 billion, compared to NOK 106.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The following items had a positive impact on the net operating income in",
          "the first nine months of 2008: derivatives of NOK 5.7 billion, reversal of impairment of NOK 2.1 billion and gain on sale of assets of NOK 1.8 billion. These were partly offset by impairment charges of NOK 5.6 billion, an accrual for expected losses on a tolling agreement (NOK 1.3 billion), underlift of NOK 1.1 billion, accrual for claims (NOK 0.5 billion) and other non operational accruals NOK 0.4 billion. Adjusted for these items, adjusted (underlying) net operating income was NOK 158.9 billion in the first nine months of 2008, compared to NOK 105.1 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The increase was mainly due to a 41% increase in prices of liquids measured in NOK, a 38 % increase in gas prices and a 1% increase in entitlement production, partly offset by higher operating expenses especially in the downstream business and higher exploration expenses. Total liquids and gas liftings in the third quarter of 2008 were 1,504 mboe per day, compared to 1,660 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2007, a decrease of 9%. There was an underlift in the third quarter of 2008 of 29 mboe per day [*] compared to an underlift in the third quarter of 2007 of 36 mboe per day. Total liquids and gas liftings in the first nine months of 2008 were 1,691 mboe per day, compared to 1,718 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2007, a 2% decrease. There was an underlift in the first nine months of 2008 of 10 mboe per day [*] compared to an overlift in the first nine months of 2007 of 26 mboe per day. Total liquids and gas entitlement production in the third quarter of 2008 was 1,550 mboe per day, compared to 1,596 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2007. Average equity [*] production was 1,733 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2008 compared to 1,722 mboe per day in the third quarter of 2007. The decrease in entitlement production mainly stems from increased maintenance activity, shut downs and declining production from maturing fields, but was partly offset by ramp-up in production from new fields coming on stream. Total liquids and gas entitlement production in the first nine months of 2008 was 1,716 mboe per day, compared to 1,692 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2007. Average equity [*] production was up 5% to 1,892 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2008 compared to 1,798 mboe per day in the first nine months of 2007. Increased production mainly stems from new fields coming on stream and a higher gas off-take, but was partly offset by declining production",

Exploration expenditure was NOK 11.9 billion in the first nine months of 2008, compared to NOK 9.1 billion in the first nine months of 2007. The increase in both periods was mainly due to higher exploration activity and increased drilling costs. Exploration expenditure reflects exploration activities in the period. Adjusted exploration expenses for the period consist of exploration expenditure adjusted for the period's change in capitalised exploration expenditure and for certain items impacting the net operating income as described above. The adjusted (underlying) exploration expenses increased from NOK 3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2007 to NOK 3.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008, mainly due to higher exploration activity and increased drilling costs. Adjusted exploration expenses increased from NOK 6.8 billion in the first nine months of 2007 to NOK 8.5 billion in the first nine months of 2008, mainly due to higher exploration activity and increased drilling costs. In the third quarter of 2008, a total of 15 exploration and appraisal wells and two exploration extension wells were completed, nine on the NCS and six internationally. Ten exploration and appraisal wells and two exploration extension wells have been declared as discoveries. In the third quarter of 2007, a total of 15 exploration and appraisal wells were completed, seven on the NCS and eight internationally.

[*] Normalised production cost is defined as a non-GAAP financial measure. [*] The production cost per boe, both actual and normalised, has increased significantly, mainly due to non-recurring restructuring costs relating to the merger of Statoil ASA and Hydro Petroleum in 2007, start-up of new fields, increased maintenance cost and general industry cost pressure. Adjusted for restructuring costs and other costs arising from the merger recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007 and gas injection costs, the production cost per boe of equity production for the 12 months ended 30 September 2008 was NOK 33.2. The comparable figure for the 12 months ended 30 September 2007 is NOK 29.0. Net financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 9.7 billion in the third quarter of 2008, mainly caused by a NOK 0.75 (14.7%) weakening in relation to the US dollar, compared to an income of NOK 6.5 billion in the third quarter of 2007 mainly caused by a NOK 0.46 (7.8%) strengthening in relation to the US dollar. The NOK 16.3 billion negative change was mostly attributable to currency effects. Specifically, in the third quarter of 2008, currency losses amounted to NOK 11.8 billion and NOK 5.1 billion related to financial risk management and non-current financial liabilities, respectively. By comparison, in the third quarter of 2007, currency gains amounted to NOK 4.7 billion and NOK 3.1 billion related to financial risk management and non-current financial items, respectively. The net currency losses were partly offset by net currency gains of NOK 8.2 billion related to receivables which were mostly internal US dollar loans provided by a Euro-functional currency subsidiary. In the first nine months of 2008, net financial items amounted to a loss of NOK 6.3 billion, mainly caused by a NOK 0.42 weakening in relation to the US dollar, compared to an income of NOK 10.3 billion in the first nine months of 2007 mainly caused by a NOK 0.81 strengthening in relation to the US dollar. As described above for the quartely effects, the NOK 16.6 billion decrease was mainly related to net currency losses of NOK 15.3 billion and NOK 8.1 billion related to financial risk management and non-current financial liabilities respectively.

          "Record results and high production The increase in net income from the second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008 was mainly due to a 44% increase in realised liquids (crude oil, condensate and NGL) prices measured in NOK, a 49% increase in natural gas prices and an 8% increase in lifted volumes. The increase was partly offset by negative net financial income and higher taxes. The increase in net income from the first half of 2007 to the first half of 2008 was mainly due to a 44% increase in realised liquids prices measured in NOK, and a 31% increase in natural gas prices. The increase was partly offset by increased operating expenses, exploration expenses and higher taxes. \"The second quarter result is primarily influenced by high oil and gas prices. Our record earnings are also coming as a result of operational focus contributing to high production\", says Helge Lund, StatoilHydro's chief executive. \"Our equity production increased 6% from the second quarter of 2007, mainly due to new capacity both on and outside the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and higher gas offtake. A number of our fields will undergo planned turnarounds in the next quarter. In total we are on track to deliver on our 2008 production ambition\", Lund says. \"We are also satisfied with our exploration results this year. In the first half of 2008 we have completed a total of 49 exploration wells, out of which 18 have been declared as discoveries. For the full year we plan to drill at least 70 wells\", Lund adds. StatoilHydro delivered total liquids and gas entitlement production in the second quarter of 2008 of 1,710 mboe per day. Lifted volumes increased by 8% to 1,736 mboe. Combined with record high prices for liquids and natural gas, the net operating income for the second quarter of 2008 increased to NOK 62.6 billion, up 74% from NOK 36.1 billion in the second quarter of 2007. StatoilHydro delivered total liquids and gas entitlement production in the first half of 2008 of 1,799 mboe per day.

During the first half of 2008, we gained access to 15 new licenses through licensing rounds in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Brazil. This comes in addition to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the Peregrino development offshore Brazil. The acquisition is still pending governmental approval.

The decrease of NOK 3.1 billion was mainly caused by decreased net foreign exchange gains of NOK 2.3 billion, in combination with decreased capitalised interests of NOK 0.6 billion and fair value adjustments on financial derivatives of NOK 0.4 billion. The NOK 2.3 billion decrease in net foreign exchange gains was mainly related to external loans and liquidity and currency risk management and was caused by relatively less weakening of the US dollar versus NOK in the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007. The decrease was partly offset by currency effects on internal US dollar loans provided by a Euro functional currency subsidiary. Net financial items amounted to an income of NOK 3.4 billion in the first half of 2008, compared to an income of NOK 3.8 billion in the first half of 2007. The decrease of NOK 0.4 billion was mainly caused by decreased net foreign exchange gains of NOK 0.6 billion. The NOK 0.6 billion decrease in net foreign exchange gains was mainly related to increased currency losses on internal US dollar loans provided by a Euro functional currency subsidiary.

          "Solid production, good results The increase in net income from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008 was mainly due to a 42% increase in realised oil prices measured in NOK. In addition, the increase in net income is explained by higher natural gas prices, lower write-down of inventories, gains from sales of assets and currency gains. The increase was partly offset by increased exploration expenses. \"We deliver a good first quarter result characterised by solid production in a market with high oil and gas prices\", says Helge Lund, StatoilHydro's chief executive. \"Several new fields have been added to the StatoilHydro upstream production portfolio since the turn of the year, for example Volve and Gulltopp on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and the deepwater Gunashli field in Azerbaijan.\" \"We continue to build long term growth through an extensive exploration programme and active business development. We have signed an agreement to take over the Peregrino project in Brazil. This has strengthened our position in an exciting upstream region\", says Lund. \"Our exploration activity has yielded encouraging results. So far in 2008 we have confirmed 15 new discoveries, 12 in Norway and three internationally\", says Lund. \"I am content with our employees' ability to deliver results through a demanding period\", Lund adds. Return on average capital employed after tax (ROACE) (*)for the 12 months ended 31 March 2008 was 22.5%, compared to 23.8% for the 12 months ended 31 March 2007. The decrease was due to higher average capital employed, partly offset by higher net income. ROACE is defined as a non-GAAP financial measure. (*) In the first quarter of 2008, earnings per share were NOK 5.01, compared to NOK 3.05 in the first quarter of 2007. Net operating income in the first quarter of 2008 was NOK 51.4 billion, compared to NOK 34.5 billion in the first quarter of 2007. The increase was mainly due to higher oil and gas prices, lower write-downs of inventories to cost, gains from sales of assets and a slightly lower tax rate. The increase in net operating income was partly offset by higher realised cost of goods sold and higher exploration expenses. Total oil and gas liftings in the first quarter of 2008 were 1,836 mboe per day, compared to 1,890 mboe per day in the first quarter of 2007.

Exploration expenses for the period consist of exploration expenditure adjusted for the period's change in capitalised exploration expenditure. Exploration expenses increased from NOK 2.0 billion in the first quarter of 2007 to NOK 4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2008, mainly due to increased exploration activity and increased expense of previously capitalised exploration expenditures.

Including the Ermintrude find the total recoverable volume is estimated at 180-240 million barrels of oil equivalent. Tim Dodson ”This is a very exciting discovery which confirms that there is still a chance of finding larger volumes of oil in established areas such as Sleipner,” says Tim Dodson, senior vice president for StatoilHydro’s exploration activities on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). “These are positive contributions to reaching our goal of maximising the potential on the NCS.” The appraisal wells on the Dagny structure confirm that Dagny and Ermintrude, which was confirmed in 2007, have identical pressures and are located in the same structure. A joint development of Ermintrude and Dagny phased in to the Sleipner field is being evaluated. Gas was confirmed in the Dagny discovery as early as in 1978. A creative exploration organisation presented the idea that there might be an oil column below the gas. ”It is encouraging to see that the organisation’s new ideas in mature areas can lead to such good results,” says Tim Dodson.

The objective of exploration well 6407/7-8 was to prove gas/condensate in the middle/lower Jurassic reservoirs in the Noatun prospect. The well struck gas/condensates at the prospective Jurassic range, although the size of the find is as yet unconfirmed. The well has been formation tested using mini-DST, and extensive data and samples have been collected. A flank sidetrack will be drilled to confirm gas/water contact and the size of the find. \"We are delighted to have found hydrocarbons which can contribute to the extended lifetime of the Njord field, but we need more information before we can say anything about the size of the find, and any possible extraction methods,\" says Sivert Jørgenvåg, exploration manager for the Halten Bank.

          "Gulltopp sets world record The drilling equipment on Gullfaks A must be reinforced several times in order to complete the record-long and almost horizontal well Gulltopp. Tuesday 8 April was a red-letter day on the Gullfaks A platform in the North Sea. The most complicated well in StatoilHydro's history was successfully completed and hydrocarbons were flowing up through the well at 9910 metres. This is thus the longest producing well in the world drilled from an offshore platform. Arne Sigve Nylund (Photo: Kim Laland) \"This is a day of rejoicing both for Gullfaks and StatoilHydro. We were aware of the risk that Gulltopp drilling from the platform might fail. This makes it extra great that we today have successfully completed the company's most demanding drilling operation,\" says Arne Sigve Nylund, the head of Operations West in StatoilHydro. The experience gained by StatoilHydro is very valuable to the further development of both remote prospects at Gullfaks and on other fields in the company's portfolio. \"The increased range that we now envisage for platform drilling opens up new perspectives for effective exploitation of existing infrastructure, and thus increased producing life,\" Nylund says. The alternative to drilling this distance would be to locate a subsea template on the seabed. This, however, would be far more expensive than drilling from an existing platform. The challenges underway made Gulltopp considerably more expensive than initially assumed. But experience from the project is very valuable and will now be used for developing similar oil finds at a lower cost. StatoilHydro may thus save billions using this solution. Demanding job The drilling of Gulltopp has been a very demanding job that requires a go-ahead spirit, as well as innovation and perseverance. The 10-kilometre drill pipe was controlled from the drilling rig at the sea surface. It was run 150 metres down to the seabed, and then kilometre after kilometre through various types of rock strata. The longer the drill pipe is, the more difficult it is to control the forces that are transferred to the drill bit down in the deep, thousands of metres away. This requires great attention and skills by personnel in charge of drilling. \"The Gulltopp well has been a great technological challenge, and was possible thanks to high professional skills among our own drilling and well personnel, in addition to crucial contribution by the involved suppliers,\" says Geir Slora, head of drilling and wells in StatoilHydro. During traditional installation of casings the casing is filled with drilling mud and rubs against the well floor. \"There have been project delays due to subsurface conditions and demanding technical and operational challenges related to the well, brake system in the drilling rig and platform's power supply. It",
          "has therefore been necessary to upgrade the brake system and power supply,\" Slora says. Successful filling of air into the casing The working conditions below the seabed are always challenging. The conditions are unstable, with varying pressure and mixture of rocks. For Gulltopp the conditions were even worse. This is an exceptionally shallow oil deposit. For each metre to be drilled down, it was necessary to drill four metres horizontally. Most height meters must be used at the top of the well. In order to reduce the friction for Gulltopp the casing was instead filled with air. This makes the casing lighter, allowing it to be lifted from the bore hole floor. (Drawings: Jan Ulriksen) When the well was drilled far enough into the seabed to be slanted, it must be drilled almost horizontally in order to hit the target. Most of the well has a downward inclination of just seven degrees. This poses great challenges with regard to the increasing friction between the drill strings and rocks underway when the well is extended. The platform equipment has been reinforced several times during this process. But in order to drive the drill forward in the slack incline the friction in the well must be reduced. Pulling an eight-kilometre casing that rubs against the bottom of the slack well was not possible. The drilling management decided to fill the casing with air. The casing would then hover in the hole rather than lying along the seabed. This was the key to success.

          "Find in the Barents Sea This is the fourth find on StatoilHydro-operated licenses on the Norwegian continental shelf in 2008, and the fifth so far this year. The drilling in production licence 228 in the Barents Sea is completed. Hydrocarbons were proven in sandstone from the Triassic Age, and extensive data acquisition has been conducted. The results from the well show that the reservoir contains both oil and gas. It is too early to estimate the size of the finds and further data processing is required. Tim Dodson (Photo: Harald Pettersen) ”The finds confirm our expectations that additional reserves can be found in this area, and we plan to drill another well in this licence in 2008,” says Tim Dodson, head of exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf. This was the first well in production licence 228, which was awarded in the Barents Sea licensing round in 1997. The well was drilled to a total depth of 2825 metres below sea level, and was completed in Triassic rocks. The well will now be permanently plugged and abandoned. Well 7222/6-1S was drilled by the Polar Pioneer drilling rig in 364 metres of water. The next project for the Polar Pioneer is an appraisal well for PL110C on the Tornerose discovery. StatoilHydro has previously reported discoveries south-west of the Grane field and in the Fram area of the North Sea, and Gamma at Haltenbanken.

We are establishing a strong platform for further developing our gas value chain business and growing our position in unconventional gas worldwide. Furthermore, we are adding significant resources to our portfolio. The agreement we have entered into with Chesapeake provides us with a solid position in an attractive long-term resource base at competitive terms.” Mr Lund added: “This deal adds a major building block to the gas value chain position we have established in the US, the world’s largest and most liquid gas market. This is a significant step in strengthening our US gas position, building on our existing capacity rights for the Cove Point LNG terminal, our gas trading and marketing organisation and the gas producing assets in the US Gulf of Mexico.” Chesapeake’s Chief Executive Officer, Aubrey K. McClendon, said: “We are honoured to establish a business relationship with StatoilHydro and are excited about the mutually beneficial nature of our transaction with them. We believe this transaction creates substantial value for both companies and unique opportunities for international growth with one of the leading international oil and gas companies. Jointly we can export our world class unconventional gas technology for further long term growth.” Both companies believe that the development programme could support the drilling of 13,500 to 17,000 horizontal wells over the next 20 years with a continuous programme using up to 50 drilling rigs. The expected cost for each well is estimated at approximately USD 3.5 million with an ultimate recovery of approximately 560,000 boe per well. The transaction is expected to close by year end.

          "Drilling gear deals “These deals will boost administrative efficiency in ordering and delivering such gear to fixed installations,” says Tore G Teige, vice president for project management in the drilling and well cluster. “Standardised equipment and shorter delivery times are other economies of scale we achieve through the agreements.” He adds that StatoilHydro has found more need to coordinate drilling gear deliveries since the merger. “We’ve also seen greater opportunities for such solutions.” Packages An enquiry was sent to suppliers this spring, with drilling equipment requirements for the group’s installations divided into a series of packages. Frame agreements covering up to two suppliers have been concluded for each package, applying price and quality as the basis for making a selection. The deals run for three years with two options for StatoilHydro to secure two-year extensions. Where service and spare parts are concerned, agreements run for five years with two five-year options. Suppliers who have been awarded frame agreements are Aker Solutions, National Oilwell Norway, Step Offshore, Weatherford, Scomi Oiltools, Halliburton (frame agreement and contract), MI Swaco and Cameron. Tested One of the selection criteria was that only tested technology would be used, Mr Teige reports. “We can’t install equipment which hasn’t been subject to proper testing. At the same time, however, we feel it’s important to focus on new solutions. “One bidder presented a technological advance which improves health, safety and the environment. We want to secure a letter of intent which will allow us to use this product once it’s been further tested.” Significant Equipment covered by the agreements will be significant for the future operation of StatoilHydro’s fixed installations, notes Fredrik Stang Rydin, procurement vice president for projects. “The deals will be important for long-term planning of the upgrades required on our facilities.

(Photo: Kim Laland/Bitmap) ”This is a unique technology testing endeavour crucial for assessing subsea compression as a possible solution for offshore fields like Åsgard and Mikkel,” says Rolv Herfjord, StatoilHydro Åsgard Minimum Flow Project manager. Subsea compression can be the future solution for gas boosting of subsea completed gas wells. “Åsgard is in many ways tailor made as a front runner for qualification of subsea compression as the compressor unit on the sea bed will serve a number of wells and thus distribute the cost for qualification on a large gas volume. In addition, the motor drive (frequency converter) can be located on the Åsgard B platform, and the installation of the subsea compressor station would be in a familiar depth,” explains Herfjord. “If the testing is successful, we can assess using subsea installations instead of offshore platforms.” World-class test site “K-lab is a world-class facility that can analyse, test and qualify various types of gas processing equipment - including subsea compressors and pumps, high-pressure separation units, multi-phase meters, valves and pipeline pigs – all in full scale,” says K-lab manager Trond Austrheim, StatoilHydro Technology & New Energy. K-lab is particularly well suited to carry out full-scale testing and qualifying of subsea compressors in realistic conditions. More than NOK 250 million was invested to upgrade the lab’s subsea compression testing facilities. The upgrade has been financed by the Åsgard Minimum Flow Project which is evaluating subsea gas compression as a possible solution to boost the gas production from the Midgard and Mikkel area for the Åsgard/Mikkel License Partners (StatoilHydro, ExxonMobil, Total, ENI and Petoro). Two compressor prototypes – a MAN Turbo and Siemens unit – will be tested at K-lab over a two-year period. The MAN Turbo unit was installed this past winter and the Siemens compressor will be ready for trials in 2009. K-lab is 100% owned by StatoilHydro, but also does projects for equipment suppliers. Subsea future StatoilHydro has a number of fields that could utilise subsea compression. Subsea compression is another step towards the reality of someday performing all facets of hydrocarbon production, separation, transport and maybe even final processing from the sea floor.

This is an impressive piece of work performed after the merger. We must give credits to those that have created this,\" the Farmand Activum chairman Stølann says. The Farmand award for the best website has been presented since 2006. It is based on the same basic principles as the traditional Farmand award. \"This is simply an impressive website. It is probably the best website ever developed by a Norwegian enterprise,\" says Arve Stølann. Stølann is the chairman of Farmand Activum AS, the company responsible for the award. He was also a member of the judging panel. StatoilHydro.com was launched on 1 October 2007, the day of the merger between Statoil and Hydro's oil and gas division. But the work on the website has been an extensive development project that started long before the website was rolled out. A success story from the merger \"This is a fantastic recognition of our merger and integration work,\" says Kjetil Undhjem. Kjetil Undhjem (Photo: Øyvind Hagen) He and his colleagues in Brand Management supervise the strategic part of the website work. \"StatoilHydro.com was set up as a merger project with people both from Hydro and Statoil. It ended up as Norway's best website",
          "- this is a fantastic merger story,\" Undhjem declares. StatoilHydro.com was generated using a brand new technology tool; its appearance and structure were redesigned, and it was filled with new and touched up content.

The improvement potentials on the Norwegian continental shelf and opportunity to take part in the development of the Shtokman project support the logic of the merger and are early indications of the opportunities and potential that the merger has created,\" he maintains. The StatoilHydro board of directors characterises the merger of Statoil ASA and Norsk Hydro's oil and gas activities on 1 October 2007 as a forceful response to increasing complexity and international competition in the industry. The successful merger represents an important milestone in a year marked by a historically high level of activity, the board maintains. Other important milestones in 2007 are the completion of the Ormen Lang project and first shipment of Snøhvit liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the plant at Melkøya. In addition, eight projects on the Norwegian continental shelf and five international projects have come on stream during the year. StatoilHydro's entitlement production of oil and gas totalled 1 724 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2007. The contribution from the international part of the business was record high, accounting for 18 percent of the entitlement production. The annual result for 2007 totalled NOK 44 641 million. The board of directors proposes to the annual general meeting that a total ordinary and extraordinary dividend of NOK 8.50 per share be paid. The report will be published on StatoilHydro's website: www.statoilhydro.com and will at the same time be emailed to shareholders that prefer to receive the report electronically.

          "Volve field signals a fresh approach The Volve field has been developed with the world's largest jack-up platform as its mainstay. This gives increased flexibibility and lower costs for a field that is predicted to have a shorter lifespan than other North Sea fields. (Photo: Colin Dobinson) \"Against a background of high oil prices and diminishing production from mature fields, we must be willing to think afresh,\" said Torvund. \"We have strategic focus on maximising returns from the Norwegian Continental Shelf, and we see a trend towards smaller and more marginal fields,\" he said. \"The classic project for StatoilHydro has been major fields. Volve shows that we are innovative and can be competitive on smaller fields too,\" said Tore Torvund before travelling out to Volve to undertake the official opening. (Photo: Colin Dobinson) Torvund, who is executive vice president for Exploration and Production Norway, held a presentation for Norwegian media at StatoilHydro's guest house at Solastranda in Stavanger on Friday morning, before flying out to the official opening on the platform Mærsk Inspirer . Mærsk Inspirer is the world's largest jackup rig, 103 metres wide and with a maximum drill string length of 9.15 km. (Photo: Colin Dobinson) The Volve field represents an important contribution to production targets with its daily production of 56,000 barrels of oil per day. StatoilHydro's share of this production is 30,000 barrels per day. \"Although it's not typically StatoilHydro, Volve represents the diversity in the way we will be operating on the continental shelf according to varying challenges,\" explains Torvund. Subcontracted to Mærsk Part of what's new at Volve is the way in which the entire operation has been assigned to Mærsk Contractors Norway. Mærsk have had responsibility for development, equipment and manning. \"It's as close as you can get to a total procurement and construction contract,\" said Torvund, while emphasising that StatoilHydro remain in charge of the geology and placement of wells. He praised Mærsk Contractors Norway for their deliveries. \"We have achieved almost 100 percent regularity already, even during the startup phase. That is something that really impresses us,\" he said, and added that he was happy that Mærsk too, were satisfied. \"When you have two parties that are satisfied, you can call it a success,\" he said. \"We have only praise for Mærsk, who have carried out their responsibilities for development, equipment and manning in an exemplarary fashion,\" said Torvund in the ceremony conducted on board.

          "on the movable installation Mærsk Inspirer , the world's largest jackup platform. The solution gives greater flexibility, mobility and lower costs than a conventional platform. The platform was towed out from Haugesund in May last year, and production came on stream on February 12. The goal is to achieve plateau production in 2008. The first cargo of 500,000 barrels of oil is scheduled to be shipped in mid-March. In the meantime, the oil is stored in the floating storage unit, Navion Saga , a converted shuttle tanker. Short lifespan may be extended The subcontracted model was chosen because of the field's relatively short lifespan, estimated to about five years and a recovery rate of 45 percent. However, plans are already underway to extend the field's lifespan by exploring nearby resources in the project Volve Future Wells. Exploration and development are taking place in parallel at a fast tempo alongside drilling, startup and commissioning. Volve South and West will be investigated first using multilateral branches, after which Theta South will be explored. The Volve field was separated from the Sleipner field, and existing infrastructure is therefore close at hand. Gas flaring will cease as soon as the compressors are running and all produced water will be reinjected into the reservoir for pressure support. In this way, Volve will also be at the forefront of environmentally-friendly operations. (Photo: Colin Dobinson) Eight wells in 2008 A total of eight wells will be drilled in 2008, and Gunnar Nakken, production director for marginal fields in Norway, points out that the projected lifespan to 2014 is based on calculations that have not been adjusted for recent increases in the price of oil. With a high oil price and good chances of new discoveries in the area, the possibilities of extending operations should be good, he believes. Good cooperation \"We are greatly looking forward to a continued cooperation with Mærsk,\" says Gunnar Nakken. He believes that the good cooperation achieved so far provides the opportunity for learning from each other and exchanging experience on this type of field. Environmentally-friendly operation When the Volve field is fully on stream in the near future, there will be no discharges of hydrocarbons to sea or air. Produced water will be reinjected into the formation in order to increase oil recovery, and when the compressors start working next week, gas flaring will also cease. Volve will therefore be at the forefront of environmentally-friendly operations on the Norwegian continental shelf.

          "Small environmental impact after Statfjord oil spill The Statfjord A platform in the North Sea. (Photo: Marit Hommedal) After the oil spill StatoilHydro initiated several environmental investigations in order to identify and, if required, reduce the environmental impacts. Sintef, the Institute of Marine Research (IMR) and the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA) have also been involved in this investigation. The report is now ready and the specialists conclude that the oil spill of around 4400 m3, which is the second largest on the Norwegian continental shelf, did not cause any demonstrable environmental harm. Three days after the incident there were no longer any visible traces of the oil on the sea surface. Analyses from Sintef show that after a couple of days 25% of the oil had evaporated and 15% had dissolved. The rest of the oil had been mixed into the churning water as droplets, gradually dissolving and eaten by the ocean’s own bacteria. “Because of heavy waves and wind, the oil was quickly mixed into the sea,” says Hanne Jorun Storhaug Ervik, StatoilHydro’s project manager for the investigation. The weather conditions were on our side and nature took care of itself. Measurement of oil components in fillet of fish from the North Sea caught in December and January indicate that all components were below the detection limit. \"No harm to the environment close to Statfjord has been proven, even though the oil spill was a very serious incident,\" says Eva Øglænd Bjørnestad, environmental coordinator for Statfjord. (Photo: Harald Pettersen) “More than 170 fish samples have been analysed without any traces of oil being found in the fish fillets,” says Bjørn Einar Grøsvik of the IMR. “Consequently, there is no reason for saying that the spill has reduced the quality of North Sea fish fillets. Other analyses of oil components in liver show slightly higher oil values in haddock during the first days after the spill than what has been reported earlier in haddock caught in the North Sea. This was, however, not the case for cod and pollack. Furthermore, no dead birds were found after the oil spill. The purpose of the investigation was to identify and reduce the environmental impacts of the Statfjord oil spill. “Our goal is zero harm to the environment in which we operate, and we immediately started extensive investigations and analyses,” says Eva Øglænd Bjørnestad, environmental coordinator for Statfjord. The work has been carried out in good cooperation and full openness with external experts (SINTEF, IMR and NINA), in addition to our in-house technical expertise. “We have gained further knowledge about environmental affects of oil spills and experience that will be useful both to StatoilHydro personnel and external professional communities,” says Ms",

New cable Gjøa is expected to come on stream in 2010. A cable running from the new power plant at Mongstad, north of Bergen, will supply the platform with electricity. \"The cable has to be able to tolerate a lot of movement and together with contractor ABB, a new high voltage power cable is being laid,\" says Kjetel Digre, project director for the Gjøa field development. \"The alternative to this would have been a traditional solution with gas turbines on the platform producing power. By electrifying the platform with a cable instead, the energy that Gjøa needs will be produced with the environmental standard of the new Mongstad power plant.

Systematic technology development has made the NCS a laboratory for the testing of new technology. This helps make the Norwegian supply industry operating on the NCS a global leader in this field. \"Extensive testing of new technology is important for optimal petroleum recovery on the NCS.

This also allows us to pioneer the use of this technology,\" says Margareth Øvrum., executive vice president, Technology & New Energy. Improved recovery 75 percent of the pilot projects represent technology designed to enhance the recovery on existing fields. This is a focus area for the company on the NCS and may contribute to increased value capture also internationally. One of the areas where extensive testing shows promising results is within drilling. Methods aimed at making drilling process safer, cheaper and more effective are being tested. A successful pilot related to this was recently successfully completed on Statfjord C. “This is an important step on the road to drastically reduce our drilling costs and will make it profitable to drill for far smaller oil deposits than now,” Øvrum says. StatoilHydro has signed five strategic technology agreements. This week the company will renew three strategic collaboration agreements with the supply companies Halliburton, Baker and Schlumberger. Solidly rooted in Norway, these companies are involved in research and technology development here. \"We want to collaborate with companies that are global leaders in their field. In addition we aim to be in the leading edge within technology development. We will challenge the best suppliers,\" Øvrum says. \"We want to collaborate with companies that are global leaders in their field,\" says Margareth Øvrum.

          "Call for action on carbon pricing \"In my view, we now have the main technical tools to reduce CO2 emissions. What we lack is a firm and predictable regulatory and economical framework. (Photo: Lars Gunnar Dahle) In his first address to the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) as CEO of the newly-merged StatoilHydro, Helge Lund called climate change “the challenge of our time” and said that the complexity of the issue challenges the world at the very highest political and scientific levels. “In fact, it challenges the capability of the very system of global policy-making,” he said. “The dilemma of fossil fuels is that they are perceived as both a blessing and a curse. Fossil fuels drive economic development, but they also impact our climate. Any constructive sustainability discussion has to recognise this dilemma,” he said. No quick fix “The world is slowly recognizing that there is no quick fix to a less carbon intensive future. Some people claim that it is a lack of will that hinders renewable energy from taking over, but such a view underestimates the huge task it is to substitute oil and gas,” he emphasised. Helge Lund said that StatoilHydro views climate change as both a challenge and an opportunity: “It is a challenge as cost of emissions affects our profits and tests our licence to operate. It is also a business opportunity as demand for clean energy and climate technology increases,” the CEO said, underlining that the company is already hard at work on solutions addressing the climate challenge. Apart for its efforts of building a more material position within renewables, including offshore wind and sustainable biofuels, Lund pointed to concrete ways in which StatoilHydro is contributing in real terms to meeting the carbon challenge: CO2 capture and storage “On the Norwegian continental shelf, we have already reduced our carbon emissions per barrel produced to a third of the industry average — the lowest anywhere. There are three main reasons for this: first, a firm policy of non-flaring under normal operations; second, early introduction of a CO2 tax in Norway on offshore operations at a level that really made an impact on the bottom line, and third, conscious design of platforms, pipelines and plants to increase energy efficiency. These are examples of doing well by doing good; in other words, saving money and the environment,” Lund said “We also have more than ten years of practical experience from CO2 storage, and at full capacity we can permanently store three million tonnes of CO2 in the fields where we are involved in carbon capture and storage projects, Sleipner, In Salah and Snøhvit. CEO Helge Lund called for a global approach to the issue of carbon pricing.",
          "(Photo: Lars Gunnar Dahle) Natural gas “Finally, and most importantly, I believe that natural gas offers our biggest opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Substituting coal with natural gas in electricity generation could reduce CO2 emissions by two thirds,” he said. “If Norway’s gas exports were increased by 30 bcm per year and all this gas was used to replace coal-fired power, CO2 emissions would be reduced by twice the total annual emissions from Norway,” he explained. “Some may see it as a paradox that I advocate the use of more fossil fuels as part of a progressive approach to climate change, but I see natural gas as an effective “energy bridge” to a less carbon-intensive world,” said Helge Lund. He is a firm believer that man-made technology offers the best solutions to man-made problems. Call for action “In my view, we now have the main technical tools to reduce CO2 emissions. What we lack is a firm and predictable regulatory and economical framework,” he said, and called for international political action to set a realistic market price for carbon. “If CO2 has a sufficiently high price, then we know what to do to reduce emissions. Governments have a key role to play – and there are tough decisions to be made. We need tough, but fair, framework conditions to drive industrial innovation,” said Helge Lund. \"In my view, we now have the main technical tools to reduce CO2 emissions. What we lack is a firm and predictable regulatory and economical framework. (Photo: Lars Gunnar Dahle) In his first address to the World Petroleum Congress (WPC) as CEO of the newly-merged StatoilHydro, Helge Lund called climate change “the challenge of our time” and said that the complexity of the issue challenges the world at the very highest political and scientific levels. “In fact, it challenges the capability of the very system of global policy-making,” he said. “The dilemma of fossil fuels is that they are perceived as both a blessing and a curse. Fossil fuels drive economic development, but they also impact our climate. Any constructive sustainability discussion has to recognise this dilemma,” he said. No quick fix “The world is slowly recognizing that there is no quick fix to a less carbon intensive future. Some people claim that it is a lack of will that hinders renewable energy from taking over, but such a view underestimates the huge task it is to substitute oil and gas,” he emphasised. Helge Lund said that StatoilHydro views climate change as both a challenge and an opportunity: “It is a challenge as cost of emissions affects our profits and tests our licence to operate. It is also a business opportunity as demand for",
          "clean energy and climate technology increases,” the CEO said, underlining that the company is already hard at work on solutions addressing the climate challenge. Apart for its efforts of building a more material position within renewables, including offshore wind and sustainable biofuels, Lund pointed to concrete ways in which StatoilHydro is contributing in real terms to meeting the carbon challenge: CO2 capture and storage “On the Norwegian continental shelf, we have already reduced our carbon emissions per barrel produced to a third of the industry average — the lowest anywhere. There are three main reasons for this: first, a firm policy of non-flaring under normal operations; second, early introduction of a CO2 tax in Norway on offshore operations at a level that really made an impact on the bottom line, and third, conscious design of platforms, pipelines and plants to increase energy efficiency. These are examples of doing well by doing good; in other words, saving money and the environment,” Lund said “We also have more than ten years of practical experience from CO2 storage, and at full capacity we can permanently store three million tonnes of CO2 in the fields where we are involved in carbon capture and storage projects, Sleipner, In Salah and Snøhvit. CEO Helge Lund called for a global approach to the issue of carbon pricing. (Photo: Lars Gunnar Dahle) Natural gas “Finally, and most importantly, I believe that natural gas offers our biggest opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Substituting coal with natural gas in electricity generation could reduce CO2 emissions by two thirds,” he said. “If Norway’s gas exports were increased by 30 bcm per year and all this gas was used to replace coal-fired power, CO2 emissions would be reduced by twice the total annual emissions from Norway,” he explained. “Some may see it as a paradox that I advocate the use of more fossil fuels as part of a progressive approach to climate change, but I see natural gas as an effective “energy bridge” to a less carbon-intensive world,” said Helge Lund. He is a firm believer that man-made technology offers the best solutions to man-made problems. Call for action “In my view, we now have the main technical tools to reduce CO2 emissions. What we lack is a firm and predictable regulatory and economical framework,” he said, and called for international political action to set a realistic market price for carbon. “If CO2 has a sufficiently high price, then we know what to do to reduce emissions. Governments have a key role to play – and there are tough decisions to be made. We need tough, but fair, framework conditions to drive industrial innovation,” said Helge Lund.",

Murmansk is used as a transhipment port for loading crude oil into large tankers sailing to Europe and the USA. Analyses oil samples The laboratory’s task is to analyse the oil samples taken from all the crudes loaded for export in Murmansk. “International experience from major oil spills shows that the spilt oil can be collected much more efficiently if its characteristic properties are known,” explains president of StatoilHydro in Russia, Bengt Lie Hansen. “This is an important cross-boarder project, as the results of the analysis will be available to both Russian and Norwegian authorities.” Regional cooperation Premises for the laboratory were provided by the Murmansk regional authorities: the laboratory is established at Federal State Enterprise Murmansk Centre for Standardization, Metrology and Certification. Regional authorities will also ensure that the laboratory gets the required oil samples. StatoilHydro has supplied the necessary equipment and organized personnel training in cooperation with Norway’s Sintef research foundation in Trondheim. Environmental programme Opening of the oil spill laboratory is a part of a broad environmental programme aimed at strengthening emergency response to oil spills off north-western Russia, implemented jointly by StatoilHydro and Murmansk regional government within the frames of the MoU about technical and economic cooperation. “The Barents Sea is a unique ecosystem, and in addition to that it is our joint fishing ground with Norway. This is why we claim that the upcoming oil and gas projects must be carried out in strict compliance with the European environmental standards and in close cooperation between all the participants,” says Yuri Evdokimov, Governor of the Murmansk region. “We need to create a front-edge emergency preparedness system that could be further upgraded and developed.” Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jonas Gahr Støre (left), his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Evdokimov, Governor of the Murmansk region, received a traditional welcome with bread and salt.

          "StatoilHydro to build first full scale offshore floating wind turbine StatoilHydro has developed HyWind based on floating concrete constructions familiar from North Sea oil installations. In this way we exploit the wind where it is strongest and most consistent — far out to sea. The project combines known technology in an innovative way. A 2.3 MW wind turbine is attached to the top of a so-called Spar-buoy, a solution familiar from production platforms and offshore loading buoys. \"If we succeed, then we will have taken a major step in moving the wind power industry offshore\", says Alexandra Bech Gjørv, head of New Energy in StatoilHydro. (Photo: Øyvind Hagen, StatoilHydro) “We have drawn on our offshore expertise from the oil and gas industry to develop wind power offshore,” says Alexandra Bech Gjørv, head of New Energy in StatoilHydro. The rotor blades on the floating wind turbine will have a diameter of 80 metres, and the nacelle will tower some 65 metres above the sea surface. The floatation element will have a draft of some 100 metres below the sea surface, and will be moored to the seabed using three anchor points. The wind turbine can be located in waters with depths ranging from 120 to 700 metres. “Taking wind turbines to sea presents new opportunities. The wind is stronger and more consistent, areas are large and the challenges we are familiar with from onshore projects are fewer,” says Alexandra Bech Gjørv. Contracts signed The pilot project will be assembled in Åmøyfjorden near Stavanger and is to be located some 10 kilometres offshore Karmøy in the county of Rogaland. The wind turbine itself is to be built by Siemens. Technip will build the floatation element and have responsibility for the installation offshore. Nexans will lay cables to shore, and Haugaland Kraft will be responsible for the landfall. Enova is supporting the project with 59 million NOK. The HyWind-prototype will be situated 10 km off the west coast of Norway, offshore Karmøy. StatoilHydro is allocating in excess of 400 million NOK to building and developing the pilot, as well as research and development of the wind turbine concept. The goal of the pilot is to reduce costs so that floating wind power can compete in the power market. “Floating wind power is not mature technology yet, and the road to commercialization and large scale development is long. An important aspect of the project is therefore research and development,” says Alexandra Bech Gjørv. The company has entered into a technology development agreement with Siemens for the project. The wind turbines must function optimally even in large waves. Need for further R&D “The wind turbines must work satisfactorily even when subjected to movements, and it",
          "must also be possible to carry out necessary maintenance to the highest of safety standards,” says Bech Gjørv.

It involves the equivalent of a year's work for several Statoil employees and can be renewed, reports Jon Bakken, head of the group's commitment in the south-west African country. The deal covers such aspects as training, expertise enhancement, organisational development and business planning. Know-how will be built up through courses and seminars as well as the posting of Statoil and BP personnel to Sonangol and vice versa. The Angolan company has a substantial need for expertise transfer in order to tackle the many future assignments it faces, reports Mr Bakken. Angola is becoming one of the world's most attractive petroleum regions in the world, with major discoveries made recently on its continental shelf. The country already produces some 750 000 barrels of oil per day. Statoil has interests in two blocks off Angola, and its commitment there will continue at full pitch next year. \"A substantial number of exploration and appraisal wells are due to be drilled on this acreage during 1999,\" says Mr Bakken.

This positive trend shows that the commitment to zero health, environmental and safety incidents in the group is yielding results. The lost-time injury frequency among employees at the Mongstad refinery near Bergen has been halved over the past year. No lost-time injuries and only one injury requiring treatment were recorded during 500,000 working hours at the facility during July-September. Nor have any lost-time injuries been suffered on Statoil's Veslefrikk, Yme and Troll A platforms in the North Sea during this period. \"This positive trend can partly be attributed to the steady and systematic efforts being devoted to safety,\" says Christina D Dreetz in the corporate health, environment and safety (HES) department. Statoil's contractors have also suffered fewer injuries so far this year compared with the same period of 1997. The injury frequency has declined from 21.7 per million working hours in last year to 12.9. The operation services unit in Oil Operations recently organised an HES contractor forum, which attracted senior management from 22 contractors.

Today's requirement that households must install a new meter costing SEK 2,500 when changing supplier will be removed by 1 November 1999 at the latest. At the same time, the maximum notice which can be required for such transfers will be cut from six months to one.

          "Step forward in Buenos Aires An action plan was agreed at the climate talks which recently ended in Buenos Aires, but no specific basis has been laid for an emission trading system. The action plan adopted by the fourth conference of the parties to the UN climate convention in the Argentinean capital sets a timetable for continued work on implementing the provisions of the Kyoto protocol. Signed by all participant countries, it is described as a small step in the right direction after the protocol was approved by the Kyoto conference in Japan last December. Although the foundations for a common international system for trading greenhouse-gas emission quotas are still not in place, work on this solution will continue in Norway and other countries. Deadlines are set by the action plan for presenting draft rules on the flexible mechanisms and emission trading. A final decision is unlikely to be reached before 2000. \"Although the Buenos Aires meeting has made some contribution, the fact that it will take longer to establish a framework of climate provisions presents industry with a problem,\" says Arve Thorvik, senior vice president for health, the environment and safety. Like other oil companies, Statoil pursues operations in various parts of the world and wants to be able to adopt measures which allow it to achieve the best environmental results for each krone spent. \"That's why we have great faith in the market-based solutions provided by the Kyoto mechanisms, and hope their unrestricted use will be accepted,\" says Mr Thorvik. In his view, work on solutions for emission trading now under way in Norway and a number of other countries must continue regardless of the pace of global negotiations. At the Buenos Aires conference, the developing countries pressed for formulations in the working programme on technological and financial aid from the industrial nations to be as binding as possible. The principal concern of the industrialised world, on the other hand, was to ensure that efforts are put into devising the international mechanisms which will provide \"credits\" for climate-related measures carried out in other countries. Efforts were made by the developing nations to secure priority for studies of the \"green\" development mechanisms meant to support climate-related investment in these countries. \"According to the Kyoto protocol, emission reductions achieved through such investment after 2000 should be credited against the investing country's future commitments,\" notes environmental adviser Frede Cappelen, who was Statoil's observer at the Buenos Aires conference. \"No corresponding provisions exist for joint implementation of projects in industrial countries or for emission trading.

Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev headed the six-strong Russian delegation, reports Sigmund Helland, head of Statoil's Russia team at head office. They were responding to an invitation issued by Statoil chief executive Harald Norvik when he visited Moscow in May. Existing collaboration with Gazprom relates to oil operations in the Pechora Sea off northern Russia, where the two partners are involved in three exploration licences. The drilling of a well in one of these holdings was recently concluded, and the results are now being evaluated by Statoil and Gazprom. A cooperation programme focused on the Pechora Sea has also been established between the two partners and Norway's Norsk Hydro group.

          "Gas research deal extended A gas research programme linking Statoil with partners in Germany and Norway is to be extended for another three years from 1 January 1999. Initiated in 1995, this partnership forms part of the group's efforts to build up its gas expertise in a changing market. The renewal agreement is due to be signed before the end of 1998 with Germany's Verbundnetz Gas (VNG), the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and the University of Freiburg in Germany. \"This cooperation has given us access to expertise we didn't have in-house,\" says Svein Birger Thaule, one of the driving forces behind the programme, in a comment on experience so far. Statoil and VNG have each made an annual contribution of DEM 250,000 to the work, and this level of funding is set to continue for the next three years. The partnership has been fruitful, says Mr Thaule. Apart from funding 18 postgraduate students, it has increased the group's know-how on gas storage in rock caverns Better knowledge of ultrasonic meters also means that big savings can be achieved by using such devices rather than traditional equipment to measure the large volumes of Norwegian gas flowing to continental Europe. Payments from gas buyers are now increasingly calculated on the basis of ultrasonic signals which meter the gas volume transported through offshore trunklines. \"When such massive amounts of gas are delivered every day, a further improvement in metering accuracy will pay off because customers receive invoices calculated on the best possible basis,\" says Mr Thaule. He adds that the collaboration has given everyone involved greater insights into factors causing inaccurate gas measurement, which will allow better solutions to be developed. \"This technology lies at the interface between us as a gas seller and VNG as a buyer,\" Mr Thaule notes.

          "Troll group seeks Dutch guarantee A halt to further asset disposals by Dutch power company SEP has been demand by Norway's Troll group. The licence, with Statoil as operator, applied to the court in Arnheim last week for an injunction against Samenwerkende Elektriciteits-Produktiebedrijven until the latter provides guarantees that existing gas sales contracts can be fulfilled. This action has been sparked by the industrial liberalisation process currently underway in the Netherlands in the wake of the European Union's electricity directive and new national legislation. The EU aims to open the electricity market in member countries to free competition. Plans now call for changes to SEP's functions, including a possible demerger of the Dutch power transmission network. This company has hitherto occupied a very central place in the Dutch energy supply sector, with responsibility for purchasing power station fuel and a monopoly on the country's electricity imports and exports. It and the Troll group have entered a two-week period of exchanging information before the Norwegian licence decides whether its interests are being satisfactorily protected. If not, a legal judgement will be sought. The court must determine whether the restructuring of SEP can continue. The Dutch company is committed to buying two billion cubic metres of gas annually from the Troll group in 1996-2015. Demerging assets from SEP could ultimately give the company problems in fulfilling this contract. Legal action by the Norwegian licence - which embraces Shell, Norsk Hydro, Conoco, Saga, Total and Elf as well as Statoil - seeks to ensure that a restructuring of the Dutch company will not undermine its financial position.

          "Netting better contact A network intended to simplify electronic information exchange in Norway's oil industry has its official launch on 2 November. While the Secure Oil Information Network (Soil) will initially provide an infrastructure for the Norwegian offshore business, a similar industry network could later be set up internationally. Internet technology allows companies to communicate more effectively in such areas as licence collaboration, development projects and operation of installations. The system also permits electronic commerce via the net. Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum are already collaborating to develop a new system for offshore air transport. Soil is a closed network with built-in safety routines which allows companies to send electronic mail to each other across corporate and national boundaries. Considerable demands have been posed for traffic flow to avoid queues on the network, reports Arnvid Underlid, who is project manager for Soil in Statoil. In addition to the three Norwegian members mentioned above, the collaboration currently embraces Amoco, BP, Shell, Procon and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Other oil companies and a number of suppliers also have specific plans to join the network in the near future. \"We hope to have at least a hundred members within a year,\" says Mr Underlid.

Employees who leave their place of work to join the stoppage must record the period as absence/time off in lieu. The Norwegian Association for Supervisors, the Norwegian Oil and Petrochemical Workers Union (Nopef), the Confederation of Professional Unions (YS) and the Norwegian Society of Engineers (Nito) are backing a stoppage from 14.00 to 16.00, in line with the national strike call. However, the Statoil branch of the Norwegian Society of Chartered Engineers (NIF) wants its members to stop work for just one hour, from 14.00 to 15.00. Although the national board of the society favours the two-hour halt, the branch regards the shut-down as a protest against the government rather than Statoil.

          "Car pool venture in Sweden A partnership which will allow Swedes to pool cars has been formed by Statoil and Swedish telecommunications group Telia. This solution could also be adopted in Norway and Denmark. It would be relevant for such organisations as housing cooperatives, says project manager Lennart Ljung in Marketing. When a cooperative wants to collaborate on a car pool, Statoil will chart demand and identify how many vehicles are required. Telia is responsible for the communications side. Car pools could also be appropriate for companies, organisations and other groups of people. The idea is that somebody who needs a car books this via the internet, an intranet or a telephone with voice mail. People in a plan can access the local booking system via their own PC. Once a booking has been confirmed, the car user is allocated a smart card with their personal code and locking function. This card will also be used to start the vehicle. The Telia system registers how long the car is in use and the distance driven, so that each customer can be invoiced on a monthly basis. Various departments at Statoil's Stockholm office will test the scheme in practice before it is launched nationwide in Sweden, probably at the New Year. The group expects to extend the car pool plan to Denmark and Norway during 1999-2000 through dedicated units at its car hire subsidiaries in the three Scandinavian countries. Calculations put the total potential market in Sweden at roughly 45 000 pool cars in 2009. Electric vehicles will also be included in the scheme.

Low prices for gas and condensate and conditions in the European gas market are the most important factors underlying this decision. Gas buyers in Italy and the Czech Republic have announced that they will not be exercising options totalling three billion cubic metres per year in existing Norwegian sales contracts. The earliest date for bringing Kvitebjørn on stream now appears to be 2003, rather than 2002 as earlier planned. To begin producing by the new deadline, however, the field must be included in the next set of recommendations from the Gas Supply Committee (FU) on sources of additional gas to fulfil existing Norwegian sales contracts. These proposals are due to be submitted to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy next March. The Kvitebjørn licensees will devote the winter and spring to reviewing the whole project in a bid to identify ways of cutting the cost of a development and improving its competitiveness. This review will include a solution for the condensate and the possibility of full processing on the field. The partners want to submit a plan for development and operation (PDO) to the authorities before Christmas 1999. Once the PDO has been sent in, the licensees aim to invite possible suppliers to tender for a number of development contracts.

The Kvitebjørn licensees will devote the winter and spring to reviewing the whole project in a bid to identify ways of cutting the cost of a development and improving its competitiveness. This review will include a solution for the condensate and the possibility of full processing on the field. The partners want to submit a plan for development and operation (PDO)",

          "Gas flow reversed Higher prices in Britain mean that the flow of gas through the UK-Belgian Interconnector is being reversed today. British gas prices have traditionally fluctuated more than in continental Europe, and its winter rates are now above charges on the continent. Running from Bacton in eastern England to Zeebrugge on the Belgian coast, the pipeline began supplying UK gas to European buyers on 1 October. Gas can be sent in both directions, but players in the British gas market say that such an early reversal of the flow is unexpected. The decision was taken on the basis of demand forecasts from Interconnector users. Transport contracts - including one held by Statoil - permit the gas flow to be reversed if that represents the best solution in market terms. No indication has been given of the likely duration of these gas deliveries to Britain. Nor are they expected to have negative consequences for supplies in continental Europe. The Interconnector can carry 20 billion cubic metres of gas annually from the UK to Belgium, and 8.5 billion in the opposite direction. British Gas owns 40 per cent of the line, with Conoco, Gazprom, BP and Elf holding 10 per cent each and Amerada Hess, National Power, Ruhrgas and Distrigas with five per cent.

          "Labour dispute lost A court has found against Statoil in a dispute over starting times for workers at the Kårstø gas treatment plant north of Stavanger. In a judgement published yesterday, the Karmsund district court - sitting as an industrial tribunal - agreed that working hours at the plant begin when employees arrive at the entrance gate. This accorded with the position taken by the Norwegian Oil and Petrochemical Workers Union (Nopef) and the Norwegian Petrotechnical Union (NPTF). Statoil had contended that working hours start when employees reach their place of work within the Kårstø complex. \"We're surprised by this judgement, but have noted it,\" says vice president Brian Bjordal, who heads the plant. \"We'll now take good time to study the reasons for the court's decision before deciding whether we should appeal.\" A court has found against Statoil in a dispute over starting times for workers at the Kårstø gas treatment plant north of Stavanger.

          "Full pitch with pipelaying Two laybarges have started laying the remainder of Europipe II in a bid to claw back lost time in this gas trunkline project. Solitaire is working on the section of line which runs southwards from Bokn north of Stavanger, while Castoro Sei has started extending the section running from an intermediate tie-in T-junction in the Danish North Sea towards the German coast. A total of 52 kilometres of the latter section had been laid by Solitaire before this vessel transferred to its present task. Due to run for 625 kilometres under water, the Statoil-operated Europipe II line will carry gas from the group's Kårstø facility north of Stavanger to Emden in Germany. The pull-in operation at the Bokn landfall was completed on Friday. With Solitaire lying about 500 metres offshore, the pipeline was pulled into the steep landfall area. Laying out to sea could then commence on Friday afternoon. Solitaire is due to cross the deepwater Norwegian Trench, which runs parallel to Norway's coast, and on to the tie-in point in the Danish sector. \"Based on earlier experience, we aim to maintain a laying speed of roughly three kilometres per day,\" says Sven Erik Falkeid, Statoil's representative on Solitaire . Pipelaying has been delayed because this vessel, which belongs to Allseas, lost the pipeline twice while laying across the Danish North Sea. To recover the time lost, Statoil is laying pipe during the winter season for the first time. Owned by European Marine Contractors, Castoro Sei will lay the southernmost section of Europipe II up to an existing length of line which crosses the coastal wetlands in Lower Saxony parallel to Europipe I.

          "Varg on stream The Varg oil field in the Norwegian North Sea was put into production on the morning of 22 December by operator Saga Petroleum. Statoil is a partner in this development, which lies in the Sleipner area. While initial output is expected to vary a good deal, the planned plateau flow is about 56,600 barrels of oil per day. Varg has been developed with a ship tied to a wellhead platform. The vessel's production capacity corresponds to plateau output, and it can store 440,300 barrels. Some uncertainty has attached to estimates of the field's reserves. Saga's latest update puts these at roughly 50 million barrels of recoverable oil. Varg is expected to produce for three-four years, reports technical manager Arne G Brevik in Statoil's department for partner-operated licences. The development has cost roughly NOK 3.5 billion, including construction of the production ship. Calculations by Saga indicate that the break-even oil price for the field will be USD 17 per barrel. Delays in building the Varg ship at Keppel Far East Levingston Shipbuilding in Singapore mean that the field has come on stream seven months behind the original schedule. Saga has advertised the vessel for sale. The operator has a 35 per cent interest in the field, while Statoil holds 65 per cent - including 30 per cent for the state's direct financial interest in offshore operations.

Owned by Navion of Stavanger, this vessel is currently producing the Statoil-operated Lufeng oil field in the South China Sea. The certificate was issued after representatives from the Norwegian Maritime Directorate, the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Administration (NVE) and Det Norske Veritas (DNV) had inspected the ship in early December. According to the Maritime Directorate, Navion Munin is the best floating installation it has ever inspected. The agency had no improvement suggestions, while the NVE and DNV made a couple of recommendations. \"It's gratifying to be the first in the world to receive this certificate,\" comments Holger Boge, Statoil's manager at the Lufeng operations office in Shekou, southern China. He reports that representatives from the Chinese authorities also inspected the MST recently, and made no demands for improvements. \"In their view, Statoil and Navion Munin have set new standards for technology, cleanliness, maintenance and safe operation on the Chinese continental shelf,\" notes Mr Boge.

Repairs after the 4 December incident on the Statoil-operated Gullfaks satellite in the North Sea are due to be completed by then, reports Gullfaks operations vice president Øivind Reinertsen. Damage to the rig has turned out to be less extensive than originally feared. Inquiries into the accident have established that it was caused when a heave compensator locked. This device is intended to offset vertical rig motion during drilling. The principal reason for the malfunction was a failure in the computerised control system. This switched operating mode from “locked open” to “automatic” without operatives realising that the change in status had occurred. “A few hours later, the compensator locked,” explains Mr Reinertsen. “We haven’t been able to establish the direct cause for this event, but several alternative explanations are available.” Before Deep Sea Trym resumes drilling, Statoil will verify to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate that the work required has been done.

This emerges from the report of Statoil's inquiry into the incident, which occurred on the Rimfaks field operated by the group in the North Sea. Substantial material damage was caused when the compensator system, used to offset vessel motion during drilling, locked during tests with a production well on this Gullfaks satellite. Repairs are currently underway offshore to correct structural damage to Deep Sea Trym . The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) has banned further use of the rig until all this work - including corrections to the heave compensator - has been completed. The NPD has ordered Statoil as operator to ensure that drilling contractor Odfjell Drilling, which owns the rig, implements the measures it is required to carry out. An assessment of and future plans for the vessel must be submitted by the group to the state agency before Deep Sea Trym can return to work. Together with Odfjell Drilling and Hydralift, which supplied the heave compensator, Statoil has also had a meeting with the NPD to report on action taken in the wake of an incident when the same equipment locked on the rig in August.

          "Critical on rig incident The accident on Deep Sea Trym on 4 December has attracted sharp criticism from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD). These critical remarks are contained in separate letters to rig owner Odfjell Drilling and to Statoil as operator of the Gullfaks field in the North Sea, where the incident occurred. Odfjell is ordered to ensure that the direct and underlying causes of the accident - which allowed oil to pour under high pressure onto the rig deck - are clarified and corrected. The company must implement the necessary measures and correct any damage caused to Deep Sea Trym by the accident. In its letter to Statoil, the NPD instructs the group to ensure that Odfjell actually implements the instructions it has been given. Although Norway's new Petroleum Act assigns much greater responsibility to rig owners than before, Statoil has an overall duty of care as operator. Statoil takes a very serious view of the incident, and its own internal inquiry team will be submitting a preliminary report in the middle of next week. The likely cause is that a heave compensator - used to keep the drill string stable during wave motion - locked after production testing in a well on Rimfaks, one of the Gullfaks satellites. Test equipment weighing six-seven tonnes came loose from the string and was thrown up inside the rig. Oil leaked out briefly before the well shut in automatically. Nobody was on the drill floor when the accident happened, but the NPD takes the view that a disaster was only narrowly averted. The state agency has banned further use of the rig.

Acreage on offer will be drawn from parts of the Halten Bank and Dønna Terrace in the Norwegian Sea as well as blocks close to existing discoveries. \"We're pleased that a new round is planned for 2000,\" comments Sturla Evensen, project manager for the current \"North Sea\" licensing round in Exploration & Development Norway. \"That improves the predictability of our planning.\" He adds that the Halten Bank is defined as one of the group's core areas, and that it will definitely apply for licences there. Before the new round is announced, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy will evaluate it in relation to the level of investment and production off Norway.

          "Sygna plan submitted A plan for development and operation (PDO) of Sygna has been submitted by Statoil to Norway's Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. Located in the north-east corner of the Statfjord area, this North Sea field contains recoverable reserves totalling roughly 63 million barrels of oil. It is shared between two production licences. While 55 per cent lies in block 33/9, part of Statfjord's PL 037, the remainder falls inside block 34/7. This is in PL 089, covering Snorre. The development solution embraces a subsea template with two production wells tied back by a flowline to Statfjord C, 21 kilometres away. Water will also be injected into the field through an extended-reach well drilled from the Statfjord North satellite. Total investment in Sygna is put at NOK 1.4 billion, with production due to start on 1 August 2000. \"The economics of this project are good,\" says project manager Øyvind Haugane. \"It meets Statoil's requirements for rate of return even at an oil price down towards USD 6-7 per barrel.\" An alternative solution involving a tie-in with Saga Petroleum's Snorre field has also been considered, but the present proposals yielded the best economics. Part of an overall plan for Statfjord's northern area, the Sygna development was one of four projects postponed by the Norwegian authorities in March. The government has determined that no investment should be made on the field before 1 July 1999.

          "Subsea expansion for 1999 Almost USD 5 billion will be spent on subsea equipment in the North and Norwegian Seas next year, according to a consultant's report. This investment will put the region in first place for using such installations, says Norland Consultants. At USD 4.7 billion, the figure for this year is almost as high. The Gulf of Mexico comes second for subsea spending, with west Africa as another petroleum province where such solutions are becoming increasingly common.

          "Wind farm plan Preliminary notification for the possible construction of a wind farm in western Norway has been given by Statoil and its partners. Proposals for a facility on the island of Smøla near Kristiansund have been submitted to the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Administration (NVE) by a joint venture linking the group with Nord-Møre Energi and Norsk Hydro. A licence application to the NVE could follow next year at the earliest, once the impact of a wind farm has been fully studied and more work is done on the project, reports project manager Petter Reed in Natural Gas Business Development. He emphasises that no decision has been taken to seek a licence. Today's terms for wind power in Norway mean that the partners do not consider the project economic. Work on the plans began in late 1997/early 1998, when a mast to measure wind strength was installed on Smøla. These measurements show that conditions in the island's flat landscape are suitable for generating power from this source. An annual average wind strength of eight metres per second would allow a large modern turbine to generate about six million kilowatt-hours per year - corresponding to the electricity consumption of at least 2,000 detached Norwegian homes. Three preliminary proposals for wind farms located at various places on the island have been developed so far. An open meeting is being held on Smøla today for the partners to answer questions from the public about a possible wind farm project. Norway currently has 18 wind turbines in operation. This compares with approximately 4,000 in Denmark, a world leader in wind power development. Globally, some 15 terawatt-hours of electricity were generated by wind power in 1997.

The long-term aim is to improve the recovery factor from 48 to 57 per cent with the aid of modern drilling and well technology, reports Gro Aksnes, petroleum technology manager for Veslefrikk operations. Some 65 million barrels of oil have been identified in addition to the basic estimate of roughly 343 million barrels in recoverable reserves for Veslefrikk. These \"additional\" barrels will be tapped with sidetracks - new wells drilled out to the side from existing producers in order to reach an oil pocket. \"We're hoping to achieve multilaterals - in other words, producing simultaneously from parent well and sidetrack,\" says Ms Aksnes. Injecting water and gas simultaneously represents another approach being considered for driving more oil out of the reservoirs. But this relatively new method requires further study. Low-pressure production is also being assessed. This involves the use of multiphase pumps to boost wellstream pressure. Statoil resolved this autumn to install such devices for the first time on its Gullfaks A and B platforms in the North Sea.

          "Long well on Åsgard The world's longest \"designer\" well drilled from a floating rig has been completed on Statoil's Åsgard development. Extending 6,920 metres on the Norwegian Sea field, this producer also ranks as the longest well of any kind by a rig off Norway, says Åsgard drilling superintendent Trond H Eilertsen. The well descends about 4,000 metres vertically. Drilling a designer well involves changing direction in three planes during the operation. After initially proceeding directly down, the well is deviated on a particular heading. It then makes a turn immediately above the reservoir to become horizontal. \"We've utilised advanced but established drilling and well technology, and exploited these solutions to the limit,\" explains Mr Eilertsen. \"Drilling the well in this way allows us to penetrate the reservoir from a desired direction in order to achieve optimal production.\" Drilled from Transocean Arctic , the Åsgard well took 70 days to complete - 15 days faster than expected. Statoil has drilled four wells longer than 6,000 metres on this field over the past two years. They all rank among the longest executed from a rig off Norway. Two were done by Transocean Arctic , while Transocean Winner and Transocean Searcher have been responsible for one each.

          "Yme satellite plans The Beta West satellite to Statoil's Yme field could come on stream in March if current plans are approved. A plan for development and operation of the find, made in the northern part of the North Sea structure last year, is due to be considered by the Norwegian authorities in late October. This project aims to produce an estimated 16 million barrels of recoverable oil via two subsea wells tied back to the template on the Yme Beta East satellite. The wellstream would be piped from there to the Mærsk Giant production platform on Yme, which lies at the southern end of Norway's continental shelf. Beta West is due to flow about 12,500 barrels of oil per day. The main Yme field currently produces some 45,000 daily barrels, reports operations manager Per Egeland. A drilling rig is due to be chartered from next spring to drill and complete the Beta West production wells. Statoil also has plans to explore for oil on the southern part of this structure while its northern extension is being developed, reports Mr Egeland.

          "Enhancing flight safety A series of measures is being adopted by Statoil to enhance the safety of offshore travel by helicopter. Cutting landings and shuttle flights while ensuring people spend as little time as possible in the air, these steps follow last year's crash near the Norne field in the Norwegian Sea. A project set up by the group after that incident has aimed to make helicopter flights safer and to improve the organisation of emergency response systems. Some of the measures proposed by this study have already been implemented, with both emergency response plans for the public affairs service and counselling support for personnel upgraded. In addition, qualification requirements for heliguards and radio operators have been tightened up. Other plans include an upgrading of the helicopter fleet used by Statoil as new types and models come on the market in 2001. Sikorsky machines are already due to be replaced in the near future by brand-new Super Puma models. Work on a manual for air operations in the Statoil group has also been initiated, and a core team to supervise the aircraft programme is being established. \"We're very pleased with the job done by the group so far,\" says Oddvar Haugvaldstad, deputy chair for the Statoil branch of the Norwegian Oil and Petrochemical Workers Union (Nopef). \"That goes for the measures already implemented and those which are being pursued. \"But we expect Statoil to install the equipment needed to cover helidecks on the Norne and Åsgard A production ships with foam.

          "Bioprotein plant to start next month Production of bioproteins is set to begin at the Norferm plant in mid-Norway during the middle of November. Originally due to come on line in early October, this facility at the Tjeldbergodden industrial complex has suffered problems with a key circulation pump. Start-up of the world's first bioprotein plant - which is part-owned by Statoil - will be a gradual process, reports manager Kurt Strand. It is designed to produce about 10 000 tonnes of protein every year, with natural gas from Statoil's Heidrun field in the Norwegian Sea as feedstock. Initial output will be about 50 per cent of full capacity. Seventy per cent of the annual output has been sold to agricultural supplier Felleskjøpet Rogaland Agder for use as an animal feed additive. Bioprotein could also be utilised in glue production, Mr Strand notes. However, no contracts have yet been concluded for this application. Owned 50-50 by Statoil and the Anglo-Norwegian Nycomed Amersham pharmaceutical group, Norferm has developed the production method. This uses bacteria feeding on gas to obtain high-value protein.

          "Åsgard up NOK 900 million The Åsgard development in the Norwegian Sea will face a cost overrun of NOK 900 million from previous estimates. An updated investment estimate shows the total cost of the 50 per cent completed Åsgard project to be NOK 37.25 billion. \"This rise is due to an increased complexity in the development as well as higher weight for the Åsgard B platform. The NOK 900 million rise is spread equally between Åsgard A, Åsgard B, subsea facilities and risers from the seabed to the surface installations,\" reports Åsgard project director Odd A Mosbergvik. The total increase for the field installations in relation to the plan for development and operation, is 20 per cent. Work to complete the Åsgard A production ship is in its final stages at the Aker Stord shipyard south of Bergen. Testing equipment on board remains to be done. Commissioning of the ship's systems is running on average two weeks behind schedule in relation to the tow-out date of 22 November. Some critical systems are three to four weeks delayed. Although Åsgard A is due to come on stream in February 1999, a delay in the tow-out date from Stord will entail a risk of postponed production start up. \"We are sticking to 22 November as tow-out date, but we have incorporated flexibility to allow for a later date followed by hook-up and mooring on the field. A final decision on the tow-out date has to be made at the beginning of November and we intend to maintain the requirement that the ship is 100 per cent completed before it leaves Stord,\" says Mr Mosbergvik. Construction of the Åsgard B gas platform is underway. The Kværner Rosenberg yard in Stavanger has started fabricating the topsides later than intended. This is due to a substantial weight increase of the topsides. \"We have agreed on a plan to regain all lost time by summer 1999,\" says Mr Mosbergvik. Fabrication of the Åsgard B modules is also slightly delayed. The hull being built by Daewoo in South Korea is one to two weeks behind schedule. \"We do not consider this delay to be dramatic and we are keeping to 1 September next year as the date of delivery to Stavanger,\" says the project director. The Åsgard B platform is due to come on stream in October 2000. Work with drilling, completion and installation of equipment and flowlines on the sea bed are on schedule.

          "Pioneering pipeline heater The world's first system for electrical heating of submarine pipelines is being adopted by Statoil. This solution will be applied to 45 kilometres of flowline running to the group's Åsgard B platform in the Norwegian Sea. The aim is to avoid the formation of hydrate. Plans call for the platform to come on stream in the second half of 2000. The heating system will then only be used when production from a well is shut in. Under such conditions, the temperature inside the flowline will sink to a point at which hydrate - an ice-like substance - could form and cause possible blockages. Almost 60 kilometres of high-voltage cable, due to be delivered in the first half of 2000, will be used to warm up the Åsgard flowlines. The new electric heating system has been developed by Statoil in cooperation with Saga Petroleum, Alcatel, Coflexip Stena Offshore and the Sintef research foundation in Trondheim. \"This method is both low-cost and environment-friendly,\" says Atle Harald Børnes, the Statoil manager for a NOK 60 million frame agreement with Alcatel Kabel Norge for high-voltage cables. \"I wouldn't be surprised if electrical heating proves to be considerably cheaper than the traditional methods for hydrate and wax control, which involve adding methanol or glycol. It'll probably be relevant to use the new system on other fields as well.\" The high-voltage cables will be attached to six flowlines while they are being laid. These lines are about six-nine kilometres long and will run from three wells on Smørbukk. Åsgard B is due to be installed on the field in 2000.

          "Estonian market leader Acquiring 24 service stations from Alexela Oil next year will make Eesti Statoil market leader for motor fuel sales in Estonia. The Statoil subsidiary, which currently has 14 forecourts in various cities, is set to boost its market share from 13 to 22 per cent after the takeover agreed on 18 December. That will put it ahead of Shell and Finland’s Neste group, which have roughly 21 and 15 per cent of the market respectively. “This acquisition means we’ve reached one of our principal goals by becoming market leader in Estonia before 2000,” says Epp Kiviaed, president of Eesti Statoil. “Taking over 24 stations of various size, spread over several parts of the country, will expand our business beyond its present concentration in Tallinn.” Ten of the company’s existing forecourts are in the Estonian capital. The deal with locally-owned Alexela Oil comes into force on 1 April 1999, and Statoil will start preparations for the takeover in the first quarter. Committed to an expanding motor fuel market in the Baltic states, the group aims to have a network of more than 110 stations in Latvia and Lithuania as well as Estonia by 2001. It currently owns and operates 73 stations in 26 towns and cities across this region.

The deal with locally-owned Alexela Oil comes into force on 1 April 1999, and Statoil will start preparations for the takeover in the first quarter. Committed to an expanding motor fuel market in the Baltic states, the group aims to have a network of more than 110 stations in Latvia and Lithuania as well as Estonia by 2001. It currently owns and operates 73 stations in 26 towns and cities across this region.",
          "Estonia acquisition Acquiring 24 service stations from Alexela Oil will make Statoil the leading supplier of motor fuels in Estonia. Agreed on 18 December with local subsidiary Eesti Statoil, this deal comes into force on 1 April. The new Statoil stations will be taken over during the second quarter, with rebranding scheduled to start during the summer. Alexela retains 18 of its stations.

          "Record Asian sales A new monthly record of six million barrels will be set for Statoil's crude oil sales to the Asia-Pacific region during December. Hailing from Norway's Oseberg field in the North Sea, these deliveries will be split into three consignments carried by very large crude carriers (VLCCs). The sweet (low-sulphur) crude from Oseberg is well suited for refineries in China, Taiwan, South Korea and other Asia-Pacific countries. But Japan's upgraded refineries prefer to utilise lower-quality oils. \"We've made a conscious commitment over three-four years to forging good contacts with the big players in this market through our trading offices in London and Singapore,\" reports Gunnar Sletvold. He is vice president for crude oil in Oil Trading & Supply. \"Time and effort have been devoted by our personnel to building up a name among Asia-Pacific customers, and we're now seeing the results.\" Interaction between the group's trading offices in different parts of the world is very important for its success in this market, says Marcel Kramer, president of Statoil Asia Pacific. \"Crude oil sales in Asia-Pacific are good for our general trading with North Sea crudes. And customers in this part of the world are often national oil companies or members of major conglomerates with whom we cooperate in other areas. Oil sales help to strengthen our image with them.\" While North Sea oils are priced in relation to the Brent Blend reference crude, prices for Middle East production are related to the Dubai equivalent. Brent Blend has previously fetched USD 1-2 more per barrel than Dubai crude, which is also of poorer quality. For much of 1998, however, the price paid for North Sea crudes in Asia-Pacific has been favourable by comparison with Middle Eastern supplies. \"That makes Oseberg oil attractive to refiners in this market, despite the long distance it has to be shipped, since it gives an improved yield of products and thereby better economics,\" says Mr Sletvold. He emphasises that Statoil only sells to Asia-Pacific customers if they are prepared to pay more for crude than the group's immediate markets in Europe. At the same time, the gap between concluding a sale and delivery will be longer since it takes about 45 days to ship crude to south-east Asia. Statoil has no problems with selling North Sea crudes even though prices are low. Mr Sletvold notes that the group cannot do anything about the Brent Blend reference price prevailing at a given time. But it seeks to take maximum advantage of the differences between the price of Brent Blend and other North Sea crudes - such as Oseberg oil. A few US cents per barrel make a big difference over a VLCC cargo. \"We're always",

          "Credit rating reduced A slight reduction in Statoil's credit rating has been made by US rating agency Standard & Poors. The decision to downgrade the group from AA+ to AA largely reflects low oil prices and the big investment required by Statoil's heavy commitment to expansion over the past two years. However, the present rating is still very good and wholly in line with a corresponding assessment carried out in April by Moody's, another international credit rating agency. Statoil is well placed by comparison with other international oil companies rated by these bodies. The highest rating given by Standard & Poors is AAA, which is held by both Exxon and Shell. \"It's difficult to determine what effect such a change might have,\" says Jan Hauge, who handles long-term loans in Finance. \"But we anticipate that it will have little impact on our borrowing costs.\" A slight reduction in Statoil's credit rating has been made by US rating agency Standard & Poors.

          "High stocks weaken prices Possible production cuts which can reduce crude oil stocks is the key issue ahead of Wednesday's Opec meeting in Vienna. Stock reports inspire the biggest market reactions, say analysts in Oil Trading & Supply. High world oil stocks are a major reason why crude prices remain low. The USA reports stocks weekly, and Europe on a monthly basis. But only part of the world - largely the OECD countries - issue such figures. So far this year, reported stocks account for only half the calculated increase in oil holdings. So large unreported reserves are being held. The amount of crude stockpiled during 1998 is put at about 180 million barrels, corresponding roughly to the annual output of Statoil's Gullfaks field in the North Sea. These holdings will be consumed sooner or later, much of them in Europe and the USA. They first appear in the regular statistics when imported. Such imports overshadow the calculated draw-down of stocks for the fourth quarter, so reported stocks are most likely to increase and exert continued pressure on prices. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its self-imposed production ceiling in the autumn of 1997, more or less at the same time as the Asian economic crisis was escalating. Combined with a mild winter, this prompted a substantial build-up in stocks for the first half of 1998 and a consequent sharp fall in crude prices. As a result, Opec made substantial production cuts during the summer to create a virtual balance between supply and demand in the third quarter. Increased winter demand usually causes reserves to decline substantially. But a normally cold winter this year and persistently low Asian demand mean that stocks will continue to grow in 1999, according to Statoil's analysts. However, this increase is likely to be much smaller than in the present year because of Opec's production cuts. With existing stocks already high, prices will probably remain low through 1999. Any price rise depends on changes to the balance between supply and demand. A very cold winter in the USA and Europe could have a positive effect, for instance, or a possible rapid recovery in Asian economies. Opec's regular meeting this week provides a formal opportunity to announce reductions. The market is waiting to see whether the organisation simply urges its members to tighten discipline and sticks to the existing output ceiling, or whether it lowers the latter even further. A possible additional reduction in Opec production must total about one million barrels per day to prompt any draw-down in stocks during 1999.

          "Plant boosts value creation A new plant for upgrading fuel oil to diesel is set to enhance value creation at Statoil's Kalundborg refinery near Copenhagen. Known as a soaker visbreaker, the recently-opened facility came on line six months earlier than planned and well below the original budget. \"We've succeeded in reducing project implementation costs, principally because we've managed much of the modification work ourselves,\" says project manager Lars Rosenløv. \"Cutting execution time has helped to reduce the fixed project costs. And the whole organisation has been well motivated throughout.\" Statoil's own personnel played key roles in the project, with the work largely done by local contractors. Kalundborg already had a facility which alternated between thermal cracking and visbreaking - the process which handles the heaviest feedstock components. With the new visbreaker in operation, the refinery can use the existing plant exclusively for thermal cracking. The two processes are now run in parallel. \"In addition to building the new plant, we've made extensive changes to the preheating system for feedstock to ensure that energy use is optimised,\" says Mr Rosenløv. \"We've also upgraded capacity in a vacuum distillation plant which delivers feedstock to both visbreaker and thermal cracker.\" The new plant will boost annual upgrading capacity at Kalundborg by about 160,000 tonnes of diesel and roughly 15,000 tonnes of lighter products such as naphtha and gas. Egil Sæl, vice president in charge of the refinery, expects annual earnings to rise by several tens of millions of kroner after the upgrade. \"This provides a very good return on investment in the plant,\" he says.

          "VOC project prized The VOC project has won the chief executive's prize for health, the environment and safety (HES) in 1998. Representatives for the project from Statoil and its Navion shipping subsidiary were presented with their award by chief executive Harald Norvik in a ceremony at head office in Stavanger on the afternoon of 4 December. This work, which aims to recover volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from shuttle tankers, is supported by 18 oil companies. Accepting the award, project manager Arne Moe Tvedt and staff engineers Ola Ruch, Terje Berg and Reidar Vik heard Mr Norvik say that the idea behind the new technology involved is both simple and visionary. Solving a pollution problem also provides a financial gain in connection with new commercial opportunities, he added, and said the project represents creativity and inventiveness. In addition, it makes a good contribution to fulfilling the goals set in last year's Kyoto protocol to the UN's framework convention on climate change and to meeting other environmental objectives. The VOC project embraces two sub-projects with Statoil and Navion participation - VOC Fuel and VOC Absorption. Each of these aims to build a full-scale pilot plant to recondense VOCs which otherwise escape from shuttle tankers during loading. This liquid is either stored and used to fuel the ship's engines, or returned to the cargo. In assessing the four finalists for the HES prize, the jury emphasised that their initiatives must document positive effects in this area. The three other finalists also received prizes as runners up from Mr Norvik. Like the VOC project, they were picked from among 64 candidates nominated in 1998.

          "Cutting fire insulation costs A new type of fire insulation for components offshore and on land offers Statoil annual savings of NOK 7-10 million. Developed by the group together with Rheinhold & Mahla Isolering, this product is intended for piping, valves and other technical equipment, reports staff engineer Eivind Robert Oen in the core team for surface treatment. Maintaining a number of components has hitherto been complicated by the need to remove a steel insulation capsule before work can be carried out. The new solution functions as a kind of \"insulating jacket\" which is simple to remove and replace. It comprises several layers of different materials. While the outer layers provide protection against wind, weather and fire, the inner ones help to maintain a stable temperature. The insulation can be provided with inspection hatches which provide easy access to valves without having to remove the entire jacket. This solution has been developed at a cost of NOK 1 million within the supplier development programme (LUP) pursued by the Industrial Development business area. Statoil and its partner shared the investment 50-50. The group has initially adopted the new product on its Gullfaks satellites project in the North Sea, and it has also been purchased by Norsk Hydro for its Visund and Troll C installations in the same waters.

          "Diesel leak confirmed as fire cause An escape of diesel oil has been confirmed as the cause of the Sleipner A platform fire on Sunday 18 October. The leak resulted from an unfortunate technical solution and faulty adjustment of valves in the diesel supply system, according to operator Statoil's internal inquiry. This investigation has been headed by Finn Strand, manager for the health, environment and safety sector in Oil Operations. His team's findings indicate that diesel oil escaped through an air vent leading to the roof of a generator module from a 1,000-litre tank inside. The leak lasted for almost 30 minutes, with 5-6,000 litres of oil flowing off the module and down between this structure and the living quarters to the generator exhaust channel. Since the channel's expansion bellows is not insulated at one point, surface temperatures there reach around 300 degrees C - high enough to ignite diesel oil. The leak became possible because a valve had not been re-set to the open position after another operation had been completed. When diesel then was to be pumped into a supply ship on Sunday, oil entered the 1,000-litre tank as well and quickly filled it to overflowing. The overfill prevention system in the tank has been poorly designed because the metering device may show too low a level when the contents are actually overflowing. Combining this with a source of ignition in the neighbourhood sparked Sunday's fire. An escape of diesel oil has been confirmed as the cause of the Sleipner A platform fire on Sunday 18 October. The leak resulted from an unfortunate technical solution and faulty adjustment of valves in the diesel supply system, according to operator Statoil's internal inquiry. This investigation has been headed by Finn Strand, manager for the health, environment and safety sector in Oil Operations. His team's findings indicate that diesel oil escaped through an air vent leading to the roof of a generator module from a 1,000-litre tank inside.

          "Troll takes on Sleipner load Norwegian gas deliveries to continental Europe will not be affected by Sunday's fire on the Sleipner A platform. Operated by Statoil, the Sleipner area in the North Sea normally delivers some 24 million cubic metres of gas per day to European customers. About 21-22 million cubic metres of this volume is due to be supplied from Statoil's Troll A platform while the Sleipner installations are shut down. The remainder will come from the Statfjord field, also operated by Statoil, to ensure that commitments under the Troll Gas sales agreements (TGSA) are met. Troll provides a guarantee that these contracts can be fulfilled by increasing its gas output if and when other fields covered by the TGSA experience problems. The Troll A platform increased production to 94 million cubic metres per day late on Sunday evening, reports operations manager Lars Seeberg at the Kollsnes gas treatment plant near Bergen. This facility can process up to 100 million cubic metres of Troll gas every day. Daily production from Troll A normally fluctuates around 70-80 million cubic metres. Condensate (light oil) production from the Sleipner area is also being affected by the fire. This output has stood recently at roughly 17,500 tonnes of unstabilised condensate per day, says Alvin Hanson at Statoil's Bygnes transport control centre north of Stavanger.

          "Diesel oil theory for Sleipner fire A diesel oil leak could have caused the fire which hit Statoil's Sleipner A platform on the evening of 18 October. This conclusion has been drawn by the group's own investigators on the North Sea installation, reports platform manager Thormod Hope. He emphasises that no final decision has been reached on the cause of the fire. Police and officials from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate arrived on Sleipner A yesterday and an inquiry is now in full swing. \"It looks as if diesel oil escaped from a tank,\" Mr Hope explains. \"The heat from the exhaust pipes in a power station could have ignited this fuel.\" Setting a date when gas and condensate production can resume from the Sleipner area is difficult, he adds. Repairs cannot start until the police and the NPD have completed their investigations.

          "Shuttle tanker recovers VOCs Shuttle tanker Anna Knudsen has installed a recovery system for volatile organic compounds with the goal of recovering 70 per cent of such VOCs. During tanker loading and transport of oil, vaporised hydrocarbons are emitted to the environment. Instead of releasing these VOCs, they are fed into a reabsorption unit onboard Anna Knudsen and led back to the cargo tanks. Anna Knudsen is the first shuttle tanker to install a reabsorption system. \"Commissioning of the new VOC system on Anna Knudsen is under way. Permanent testing will start in December and is due to continue until the end of March,\" says project manager Arne Moe Tvedt in Statoil. Anna Knudsen transports oil from the Statfjord field in the North Sea. The main source of Norwegian emissions of VOCs is through offshore loading of oil. Preparatory modifications have been made on shuttle tanker Navion Viking (previously Polyviking ) so that VOCs can be used to fuel the ship. Completion of the recovery system on Navion Viking will start in the first quarter of 1999.
